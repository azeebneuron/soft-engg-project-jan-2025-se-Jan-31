{"wWwr0tDSqnE": {"video_id": "wWwr0tDSqnE", "title": "Demo: Hello World | Python for Beginners [6 of 44]", "transcript": ">> So, Christopher has\nshown you how to get Visual Studio Code working\nwith the Python extension, now let's go into\nVisual Studio Code and actually start trying\nout some of our code. Now, when you work inside\nVisual Studio Code, you're going to need to create\na folder on your file system first, and that's a place where you can keep all your files together\nthat you're working on. So I've already gone ahead\nand I've created a folder. So as soon as I open\nup Visual Studio Code, I'm going to want to\ngo to \"File,\" \"Open folder,\" and open up that folder\nthat I've precreated. So I've already created a folder called Intro to\nPython development, I'm going to open that folder now, and now that gives me a place to store all the files I'm\ngoing to be working on. Once I've got that folder\nopen and I can see the folder name listed\nover here on the left, then I can say \"New file\" to create a new Python file\ninside that folder. So now, I can try out\nthat print statement. So we say, ''Print, Hello world.\" Now, initially, there's no way that Visual Studio Code can tell that what I've written is a Python module. So it's when I save the file that I tell Visual\nStudio it's Python. So I'll just save it\nby going to ''File,\" \"Save,\" or Control S if you\nlike keyboard shortcuts, and once it's saved, I'm going to make sure I\ncall it Helloworld.py, and that PY extension is a cue to Visual Studio Code that I've\njust created a Python script. You'll see right away\nsome colors appearing. That's a good sign because\nit's actually using code highlighting to indicate that the hello world is the string\nby showing up in red and so on. So I can tell now that Visual Studio Code recognizes\nthis as a Python script. Then I want to run that. So to run that code, and this will be\nyour ultimate test of whether you got all your Python\ninstalled correctly, you just type \"Python\" and\nthen the name of your script, and I called mine Helloworld.py. If you forget your file name, don't worry, it's at\nthe top of the tab, and then you hit \"Return\"\nand sure enough, there's Hello world\ndisplayed on the screen. So I've successfully run\nmy first script in Python. As I mentioned, you can put single quotes or double quotes\naround your string. I'm just going to use Control S\nto save that file again, go back to \"Command\nline,\" I'm going to use the up arrow which allows me to\ngo to the previously run command, and rerun my script, but this time with double quotes\naround the string, and sure enough, still\ndisplays Hello world. So as I mentioned, single quotes, double quotes, either\none will work just fine. Now what if I want\nsomeone to input a value? Well, I could create\na variable called Name, and say \"Input, what is your name?\" Then I can say hello, and then maybe after I say hello, I say let's print\nthe name on the screen. So let's say hello to the person\nwho has typed in their name. So now, save that. Go to my code, rerun that, and it says, \"What is my name?\" My name is Susan, and now I see \"Hello Susan\"\nappearing in the output. So the input command I said is a way for me to ask\nfor input from a user, and then I can take that input and store it back inside a variable. Once you start having multiple lines of output displaying on the screen, you may want those blank lines. So at anytime you can do\nsomething like \"Print, hello,\" and then I\ncan just say \"Print, world,\" and you will notice\nthose appear on different lines, so you can see hello world\nappear in different lines. I'm going to show you\nanother useful little command in Visual Studio Code here, we're starting to get to the bottom\nof the command line output. So it just typing the word\n\"CLS,\" we'll clear the screen and take us back to\nthe top of this output here. Useful little thing when you've got a lot of outputs\ndisplaying on the screen. Another way of putting output over multiple lines\nis you can use that slash n. Slash n is\nan escape character that means, please insert a new line. So that will also display a line\nof code over two lines of output. So slash n is a way of saying\nnew line, right inside a string. This is really handy when used when displaying output to use\non a console application, but as I mentioned,\nprint is also very popular for coders trying\nto debug their code. So if I was writing some code\nthat was doing some math, x equals 532 plus 12, and then I say y\nequals x divided by 0, now I know that dividing by 0\nis going to cause an error, and then I say \"Print, yay I did math.\" So I write a very simple\nlittle program here, and I save it, and I go down, and I run that program, and it blows up. Now, I'm using\na very simplified example. You can probably look at my code and guess which line\nof code blowed up. It's the divide by 0. But what if this was inside a 500, 600 line program with\nmultiple modules and functions, sometimes it'd be trough to track down where that line is blowing up, even though in the error message it does give you a line number\nwhich gives you a hint. So sometimes when I'm\ntrying to debug my code, I will literally write things like saying ''Adding numbers,'' sorry, promised I would use\nsingle quotes here, 'Adding numbers', and\nthen I add my numbers, and then I'll say print, 'dividing numbers,' and then\nI will divide the numbers, and then I have\nmy print statement saying, 'Yey I did math.' That way, when I go\nand I run my code, you can see that the adding\nnumbers message appeared, the dividing numbers\nmessage appeared, and then I got an error message. So it can help me flow back through my code to figure out\nwhat code executed successfully, and whichever print statement\nI didn't see is probably the one right\nafter the line that failed. So don't be afraid to use print\nstatements as a debugging tool, as you're learning to code."}, "JA3sCmrv11M": {"video_id": "JA3sCmrv11M", "title": "Introduction to semiconductors", "transcript": "Welcome everyone my name is Digbijoy. And today we shall begin this new course Fundamentals\nof Semiconductor Devices. It will be a 30 hour long course. I will be recording lectures for you; I will\nbe taking this course. Many of you might have read about or studied\nabout semiconductor devices, but this course will be a little bit different in the sense\nthat we shall try to correlate semiconductor devices with practical real life applications. We will make it less mathematical, I mean\nthey has to be mathematics, but it will not be very complicated course. We will try to make sure that there is no\nprerequisite. So, even if you have passed your 12th board\nexams, you should be able to understand the concept of this course with the basic that\nyou have learned. It will also have elements for people who\nare doing post graduate or PhD, there will be sufficient concepts for thoughts, but the\nidea of this course is to train you and train you to learn how to analyze and understand\nsemiconductor devices, because it is a very important aspect or branch of electronics,\nphysics, material science and so on. In many institutes of this country, semiconductor\ncourses are thought, but you know the practical correlation with devices and many of the fundamentals\nare probably not in covered in very great details. So, we will try to do that here ok. Now, today is the first introductory class,\nfor so 1 hour we shall discuss about what is semiconductor, where are semiconductors\nused, what are the types of semiconductor and introduced very basic concepts of semiconductor\nbands ok. Even if you have not heard about these words\nlike bands and band diagram, you should not be worried. We shall go very slow, we make sure that you\nunderstand each and everything that we discuss here ok. So, semiconductor devices are everywhere the\nvery reason you are able to see me and I am able to talk to you is because use of semiconductor\ndevices. You are very well aware that all our cell\nphones, mobiles, laptop, ThinkPad\u2019s, everything we have processors, memory devices, logic\ndevices, they are all made of semiconductor devices by the way right. So, the transistor which revolutionized our\nelectronics industry that transistor is one of the most important semiconductor devices\nthat was invented and that has eventually triggered the IC revolution, the integrated\ncircuit revolution. In the last 50-60 years you are very aware\nthat the integrated circuit revolution has accelerated the progress of mankind faster\nthan probably anywhere else in the history ok. It is incredible the things that are shaping\nup and you may not be aware that semiconductor devices are used in. So, many other applications outside of mobile\ncell phones and laptops just so many other applications which you may not be aware ok. For example, your electric vehicles that are\nstarting to populate the roads increasingly, you know there are semiconductor devices to\nenable charging of these vehicles. You have to convert power; you have to convert\npower from say kilowatt to watt or watt to kilowatt ok. All your high speed application like radars\nand satellite transmission communication also need transistors that can operate at very\nhigh speed and very high power. You know semiconductor devices are also used\nfor optical devices. All the white light LEDs that you are using\nnow to light up, the street, the stadiums, the houses everything that white light LED\nis a semiconductor device. Solar cells are semiconductors. Photo detectors and photo sensors are also\nsemiconductors mostly. There are varieties of semiconductor devices\nthat are revolutionizing our lives ok. So, it is very important for us to understand\nhow the semiconductor devices work, what is semiconductor and so on. You might know of course, semiconductor is\nsomething that has a conductivity between metal and insulator, but that is not enough,\nwe shall go more deeper into the concepts of semiconductor ok. So, I will start using white board or writing\ninstead of slides, so that we can actually get the ideal very closely. So, the word semiconductor and you know I\nwill use different color maybe semiconductor ok. Conductor is what conducts electricity very\nwell like metals right; and insulators are like wood and glass which cannot carry electricity\nso much. But the word semi conductor this word semiconductor\nmeans those materials whose conductivity can be tuned or tailored you know that probably\nmost of you know. You see if you have a piece of metal it is\nvery difficult to change the conductivity, I mean you can raise the temperature that\nis different, but at room temperature for example, if you shine light or do anything\nelse, it is very difficult to change the conductivity. Or if you take a piece of glass for example,\nit will not conduct electricity no matter what you do, it is very difficult right. So, there are these materials call semiconductors\nwhere you can change the conductivity. All of you know what is conductivity? You know resistance right, resistance follows\nthe ohms law typically V by I. So, conductivity is sort of the reciprocal\nof resistance or resistivity. So, you know how much current a material can\nconduct is a measure that connectivity measures that quantity. And semiconductors that is unique materials\nwhose conductivity can be tuned by many many orders of magnitude and that is there beauty. Because of that property you can make devices\nthat can cater to your needs ok. You can use semiconductor as a switch, you\ncan use it as a switch electrical switch ok. You can use it as an amplifier. What does a switch do? A switch will basically it will it will have\nan on state. So, it will let current go in some condition;\nit is a off state, so it will block the voltage and not allow current to go in another state,\nthat unique property cannot be there in metal. You cannot make metal go into off state. A metal will not be able to block voltage\nright. If you apply 100 volt or 200 volt and you\nexpect you know pico amps of current, it will not happen right. Or a glass you cannot expect a very high current\nampere or milli ampere to flow at very low voltage, it will break down at very high voltage\nby the way. So, only semiconductors have that unique property\nthat it can both allow very high current to flow, it can also block very large voltages\nlike insulators, so that is the beauty of semiconductor that we can use as a switch. And that has so many applications you know\nthat has so many applications that I will come. Then you can use it is an amplifier. What amplifier does is that? It amplifies, it enlarges the signal ok, and\nthat has a gain; and that gain can be used in many RF devices for example, right. It can be used as a logic device right. As a logic device your CMOS logic as a memory\ndevice, you can use it is as for memory right where to store information, there are so many\nthings you see. You can use it as an LED that emits light. You can also use it as a laser diode right\nin a laser pointer for example, and so many other uses. It you can use it as a solar cell; you can\nuse it is a photo detector; all these devices are actually influencing and revolutionizing\nour lives. And these are enabling the larger industry\nthe electronic industry for example is heavily dependent semiconductor devices right. So, this course will be basically understanding\nhow does different devices work. And what is what are the basics of semiconductor\nand will never lose side of two things one is that the concepts have to be simple so\nthat we all understand what we are talking about. The concepts have to be simple and explain\nwith, the second point is that they have to we have to explain all the concepts with practical\nexamples and you know practical correlations so that we know with the world that we are\nliving in how this devices relate ok that is very important. So, this is broadly the outline of the course. We have different themes, different topics\nwithin semiconductors that we will cover right, many devices that we will cover and basics\nof semiconductor that we will cover here. So, let me change the pages. So, we will have 30 lectures. So, today is the first lecture right. We will have 31 hour lectures. And we shall we shall study devices, the second\nyou know the broadly if I split the course into 2 halfs. And here I will the first half of this whole\ncourse you know will be basics. So, in basics we will discuss about the basics\nof band, you know there is something call band and band diagram. If we are not familiar with this terms do\nnot worry we shall definitely understand very clearly what band diagrams mean. And you know the moment you understand band\ndiagram, you can understand devices. The Nobel laureate Herbert Kroemer, he got\na Nobel Prize in 2000 for you know developing hetero junction and optoelectronic devices. He says that if you cannot draw band diagram\nfor a semiconductor device, it means that you do not understand semiconductor device. So, the moment you understand band diagram,\nwe can understand semiconductor devices very well ok. And so, we shall introduced the concept of\nelectrons which you know and holes which might be a new concept to you ok. We will introduce concepts of doping. What is doping? Doping is basically the ability that the process\nof changing the conductivity of a material right by introducing some impurities. We will introduce the concept of doping. We will introduce the concept of some statistics\nagain not too much mathematics, but very basics. Why do you need statistics, it is actually\ncall of Fermi-Dirac statistics. Let us not get scared about the word here. The Fermi-Dirac statistics basically is a\ntype of statistics that will help us explain the semiconductor you know how electrons are\nthere in semiconductor, how current flows and so on, so many other things will be discuss\nthere. We will also discuss about transport, the\ncurrent transport in semiconductor, eventually semiconductor devices have to carry current. All the processors and logic devices in your\ncell phones or laptops, they have to carry current, small current in their circuits. So, how do current flow, that transport we\nshall discuss. There are different ways of transport in you\nknow way in the current transport happen. And also that depends on something called\nhow carriers recombine they something called carrier recombination. We should not worry so much about it right\nnow. But how carriers will recombine, we will discuss\nthat right. And we shall introduce the most common thing\nthat we always learn which is p-n junction. I am sure you have heard about or read about\np-n junction in even in your class 12 or 12 standard boards very briefly. So, we shall go to the p-n junction. And pretty much that will be your basics you\nknow there will be some other things I am not writing it down here, but more or less\nthis will be how your basics will come up ok. And the device we shall definitely study MOS\nand MOSFET right. MOSFET devices are the most common devices\nthat are used in electronics. Nowadays of course, there very highly scaled\nok that is a different things. We shall also study about BJT; it is a bipolar\njunction transistor. It is a different type of transistor that\nwe use. And we shall study very briefly about solar\ncell which has to be there, you know our Indian government is spending so much on solar cell. We need to know what, how solar cells work. We will also study about LEDs and photo detectors\nvery briefly one one lectures probably each right. And we shall study about transistors for and\ndiodes for different applications ok, transistors and diodes, how are they engineered, how are\nthey tailored for say high speed applications or maybe for high power applications right,\nor may be for low noise applications right. So, many applications are there may be for\nmemory and logic right. So, how are transistors decided or designed\nor tuned in order to cater to this different needs separately. We shall also go through them ok, and that\nwill be the basically the summary of the course that we have. The many new things that we will come across\nhere, many things that we may not have heard before, but we shall definitely start as if\nwe do not know anything and we will start from there ok, we will start from there. So, the most important thing in semiconductor\ndevices you know I keep telling that semiconductor devices have revolutionized our lives. And our semiconductor devices have evolved\nyou know from if I look at 1948 is when the first transistor probably you know BJT was\ninvented at Bell labs in US it is you know. And from 1948 to 2018 now, sorry 2018 now\nthings have changed immensely. Now, you have hand held Smartphone\u2019s, I\nmean it can do crazy things right. So, this evolution has happened over so many\nyears right. And if you take any chip, if you take any\nchip, there many transistors in a chip that do they work right. The number of transistors in a chip they double,\nthey become two times almost every one and half years ok. The number of transistors in a chip double\nevery roughly every one and half years and that is called Moore\u2019s law, because a person\ncalled Moore have observed this and predicted this long back in 1960s and 70s that you know\nevery two years, the number of transistors is doubling. What is means is that transistors are becoming\nsmaller their shrinking the sizes and that is why we are able to accommodate more and\nmore transistors in the same chip. So, the number of transistors is doubling\nevery one and half years. And secondly, when you can pack more and more\ntransistors in each of this chip, then the complexities and functionalities also become\nlarge. So, you can do more and more sophisticated\nwork a computer in 1980 was not as advanced as in 1995 for example. And in 2004 laptop was sufficiently more advanced. And now in 2018, for example, a Smartphone\nis much more smarter and sophisticated, then a laptop of 1990 or you know 2005 for example. So, this is the evolution of transistor that\nhappened over a large amount of time in over the last 60, 70 years. And transistor is not the only device of course,\nthere are diodes and detectors and so many other things, but transistor is one of the\nmost fundamental building blocks of all our circuits right. And transistor is a semiconductor device that\nwe shall come about. We shall discuss transistor in details, but\nin very brief a transistor is a device where the current flowing between two terminal A\nand B is not decided by the voltage that you applying between A and B, but by the voltage\nyou applying at another point C, so that means, the voltage that you apply at point C can\ncontrol how much current is flowing between A and B. So, it can be used as a switch it\ncan be used as an amplifier and so many other things right that is a transistor in essence. Now, this is evolution of transistor and you\nknow and 2018, the transistor sizes have become so so small that you need super powerful electronic\nmicroscope actually to see them. And you need very advanced nanofabrication\ntechnologies to fabricate such transistors ok. When we you know about the company Intel right,\nIntel is one of the leading companies that make this microprocessors and chips right. And Intel of course, the Samsung and all though\nSamsung has this consumer electronic product like you know cell phones, washing machine\nand TVs and what not, but Samsung also has a lot of you know technologies and facilities\nfor very highly scaled and very sophisticated chip design and transistor technology. So, this company is for example, Intel, Samsung\nand there are many others like global foundery and so on, they report the development of\ntechnology like say 14 nanometer technology or 14 nanometer node they call it. It does not necessarily mean the transistor\nis 14 nanometer, but you can say that you know the smallest feature you know that the\nspacing between two lines adjacent lines could be as small as 14 nanometer. Many things are there we will come to that\nin later classes, but you know 14 nanometer is so small. Can you get a feel of what 14 nanometer is? 14 nanometer is you know 1 nanometer is basically\n1000 times of 1 micron right, 1 micron. And you know 1 micron is basically itself\n1000 times 1000 times smaller than 1 millimeter. So if you take a ruler, you know if you take\na school ruler that you have, you have this 1 millimeters gaps right, 1 millimeter gap. If you divide that 1 millimeter gap into 1\nmillion times right, then you get 1 nanometer. So, it is very, very small, you cannot see\nit with eye ok, so that transistor has evolved from 1948 to 2018. Now, we are talking about such small dimensions\nand so many complex functionalities are there in a cell phone. So, many other areas like you know electric\nvehicles and radars, satellites also used transistors that we shall learn in this course. But so it is high time we start learning how\nsemiconductor devices are realized, and what we need to know in this course ok. So, the most important concept of semiconductor\ndevices or semiconductor is called bands. And these are energy bands actually, these\nare energy bands. Now, what are energy bands actually? Very simplistically speaking if you take any\nsemiconductor you know what are the common examples of semiconductors do you know silicon,\nsilicon is a of course, an element right it is a very the most widely used and the most\ncommonly used semiconductor by the way. You have Germanium that is also another semiconductor\nright. Some forms of Carbon also can be semiconductor\nfor example. These are elemental semiconductor because\nthis is only one material that is Silicon; this is one material that is Germanium. You can also mix two for example, you have\nGallium which is a metal, and then you have arsenic right, and you mix them together right\nand you get gallium arsenide right that is a compound. Its formula is Ga-As gallium arsenide right. This is a compound semiconductor why because\nthere are two two elements are there, this is a compound semiconductor. These are elemental semiconductors right. And all these semiconductors are characterized\nby something called energy bands ok. The moment we understand energy bands, many\nof the things will become clear right. So, in very very simple language, you know\nyou have in any and when you take silicon for example, or germanium or some other materials\nfor example, you have an energy band which is fully filled with electrons. And then there is another band which is empty\nor mildly filled ok, it is empty ok. And there is what is this y-axis? By the way, this is energy actually you know\nenergy; and what is this x-axis by the way this is distance in centimeter or meter. So, I can draw even longer which means it\nis much longer you know I am talking about diode or something. So, it is actually distance. So, I am talking about distance and this is\nenergy. There are bands there are bands one band is\nfully filled, and one band is sort of empty mostly empty or maybe there will be few carriers\nhere ok. Now, when I say fill, they are filled with\nelectrons right. Now, of course, the question that we have\nto ask is what are these bands and where have they come from, you cannot magically say that\nsilicon you know silicon has this bands. Why are these bands coming from? To understand that you have to go to you know\nthe fundamental each atom each element for example, you know that there are this k shell,\nL shell and then electrons that you studied in your high school physics and chemistry\nremember, we have to bring that picture into account to actually explain the bands eventually. So, let us take a much simpler example right. So, let us take for example, carbon you know\ncarbon has how many electrons, its formula is 1s 2 2 s 2 2 p 2 sorry right sorry 2 p\n2. So, it has 6, out of 6 electrons in total\nright. I am sure that you have learned this representation\n1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 6 is taught in high school and higher secondary you know 10, plus 12,\nplus 12 chemistry and physics I am sure you have learned this and the understanding is\nthat you have you know this representation and that is why we are able to understand\nthis course ok. So, we have to know this we assume that you\nknow this thing, so 1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 2 that is the representation of carbon. What does it mean? It means that you have this different shells\nknow. So, in 1 =s you know 2 electron right, you\nhave 2 electron. Then in 2s, you have 2 more electron right;\nand then 2p you have two more electron. Now, you know in 1s there are only 2 states\navailable and both are occupied by electron. In 2 states, there are 2 states in 2s, and\nboth are occupied by electron. In 2p, there are 6 states available. If you remember p or del can accommodate 6\nstates, 6 electrons, but there are only two available here ok. So, there are something that is empty ok,\nthat is for one single carbon atom right, one single carbon atom. What are we trying to do; we are trying to\nunderstand how these bands form. I told you right in semiconductor we talk\nabout some bands one when is fully filled of electrons and one band is empty. There is an energy difference between these\ntwo ok. And once we understand this concept we basically\nmove ahead we understand the semiconductor devices or concepts. So, where are these bands coming from that\nis what we are trying to understand, let us not lose track of our site. So, we want to understand how. This is only one single carbon atom, but do\nyou think a semiconductor has only one single atom, no. A semiconductor has the trillions and trillions\nof Avogadro\u2019s numbers of atoms right, I mean it is not one single atom. So, you have one carbon atom for example,\none isolated carbon atom, you get this picture. There is another isolated carbon atom very\nfar away, you get this picture. There is another isolated carbon atom very\nfar away you get this picture and so on and so forth right. In three-dimensional, you can have lot of\ncarbon atoms they are very far from each other. So, there is no problem each of them have\nthis sort of representation. Now, in actual crystal, if you take a piece\nof carbon in graphite or something like that right, if you take an actual piece of carbon,\nthe carbon atoms are actually not so far apart right, they are separated by a fixed spacing\nyou know. There are so many carbon atoms there are so\nmany carbon atoms that are equally spaced in all directions in three dimensions right. I am only drawing here in two dimension because\nthis is a whiteboard of two dimension, but you have z, x, y, in all three dimensions\nyou will have depth and this is a fixed distance by the way. This distance is fixed for each material. The spacing between two the spacing between\ntwo nearby atoms; this is a carbon atoms right. This is called lattice constant. Please remember that ok lattice constant. This is a lattice of atoms actually; this\nis a lattice of atoms. And the spacing between two nearby atoms is\ncalled lattice constant. And this is a fixed number at room temperature\nfor each material right, it is a fixed material for each material it\u2019s a fixed number. Why I am I telling all these, again the eventual\nidea is to understand how bands are formed and what are the bands? Now, I told you that for each individual carbon\natom this is the picture that we have. But I will take a different color may be here. So, let us consider one carbon atom here,\nanother carbon atom very far away, they do not interact with each other ok. There is no problem. Each of them has his own set of orbitals,\nshells, valence orbital\u2019s and everything is there, everything is fine and nice. But this is not the actual distance of carbon\nto carbon atom in a crystal. In a crystal this is much shorter. So, let us now imagine that we are trying\nto bring these carbon atoms close to each other. So, it was here, it was here, but I am bringing\nthem close sorry, so maybe I have a carbon atom here and I have a carbon atom here. So, I have pushed them I am bringing them\ncloser. Why, because eventually the carbon atom has\nto be very close very close as it is a fixed number its some angstrom the level is strong. Actually the carbon atoms have to be close\nto each other in reality. In a real carbon crystal, it is a few angstrom\nok. You know what is Angstrom, 1 angstrom, sorry,\n1 angstrom is 0.1 nanometer, few angstrom is the spacing between 2 carbon atoms that\nis in real crystal. So, I am trying to bring together 2 carbon\natoms, what will happen each carbon atom as its own shells orbitals know it as its own\n1 s 1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 6 everything is there know. The moment you try to bring them close, the\nmoment you try to as you try to bring them close, this atoms will interact with each\nother. What will happen is that you had this discrete\nenergy levels remember. When I say discrete energy levels, what do\nI mean I mean the levels like 1s you know 2s 2p, these are discrete energy levels fixed,\nfixed energy levels. This discrete energy levels, they will try\nto interact as they are coming closer you know because a real crystal of carbon or silicon\nfor that matter has so many atoms that are closely packed with each other I mean real\ncrystal is real crystal. So, this discrete energy levels will start\nreact you know interacting with each other. And what will happen is that each discrete\nenergy level that discrete energy level which is very sharp will start splitting will start\nsplitting into band. What does it mean is that one energy level\nlike this will become like a band like this, because the atoms are coming closer and there\nvalence orbitals are now interacting with each other right, and that\u2019s why one discrete\nenergy level will now split up. So, how do I, write it more clearly? So, for example, on the x-axis I am plotting\ndistance r, I am plotting distance; on the y-axis, I am plotting energy. So, far away I have see I will not talk about\n1s 2 because the in carbon 1 s 2 is the inner most orbital know. And that inner most orbital exchange do not\ntake part in that interaction so much. And inner most inner most electrons also do\nnot contributed is you know energy band gap formation so much. We will come to that. So, we will only talk about 2 s 2 and 2 p\n2 2 p 2. So, I have a level which is 2 s 2 which is\na sharp discrete level, when r is far away ok. So, this is r, r is large the atoms are very\nlarge and far apart from each other, so these are discrete level that is there. And then you have a discrete level 2p2 which\nis also one single level discrete level ok. Now, you are bringing them close and close,\nso r is reducing. What will happen is that this energy level\nwill now start to split like this ok. This energy level also will try to split like\nthis. Why are they splitting, because they are interacting\nnow. And because they are interacting the levels\nare splitting into a continuum of bands this is called a continuum of states. Actually when I say band there are many small\ndiscrete states that are formed like this. It is called a continuum a continuum of discrete\nlevels which appear they appear as a band ok, they appear as a band. These are discrete levels that are so much\nin number that the whole thing appears like a band an energy band that\u2019s why I am talking\nit is a band; it is not a discrete level. So, this is splitting up here ok. This is splitting up here. And this they will merge for example, ok,\nthey will merge here ok. And then again they will go something like\nthis here. So, I will tell you these are what is happening\nhere is that these are filled I mean these are not filled, I mean these are merge states\nthat are forming. These are merge states that are forming. So, you see in 2s2, there are two states and\nthere are 2 electrons you agree. So, if I take if I take large number of atoms\nsay n atoms, there will be 2 N states and 2 N electrons. Do you agree? N is a large number, in p you have 6 N states. If I have N atoms, I have only 2 N electrons. So, in this part now as just splitting the\nbands is splitting right, this part you see this is by the way r is decreasing ok, r is\ndecreasing, your distance is decreasing. What does it mean, it means the atoms are\ncoming closer and closer ok. In this part, this energy states have merged. And what is the total number of available\nstates now 6 N plus 2 N 8 N states are now available, energy states are available. And how many electrons are their 2 N here,\n2 N here, so 4 N electrons available. And there are 8 N states. Are you getting my point? I am talking N is a large number of electrons,\nlarge number of atoms sorry ok. Many carbon atoms are coming together and\nthese are carbon atoms coming together at far away they are discrete levels you are\nright you have learned in your high school and 10, plus 2 physics and chemistry. But as you are bringing them close and close\nthe energy levels are splitting into continuum of levels which look like bands. And these bands will merge. They form this particular you know merged\nbands, and then again they spit up here, because it is actually continuing right this actually\ncontinuing like this, this actually continuing like that ok. So, what happens is that what happens is that\nthis part now this 8 N states will split up is 4 N states here and 4 N states here. This 8 N here know there were 8 N here, they\nsplit up as 4 N and 4 N. And because there are only 4 N electrons, this 4 N electrons\nwill occupy this. So, there will be 4 N electrons here and this\nwill be empty completely, there are no electrons their right. And you see this is this point this distance\nwe say r equilibrium, this is the equilibrium spacing between the atoms in a carbon atom\nwhich what it means is that in a real carbon crystal like graphite this is actually the\ndistance at which the atoms exists distance with respect to each other. And at that point you see there is a gap here,\nthis is a gap know this is completely empty. As I told you four N states are empty and\nthis is 4 N states are filled they are separated by a gap this is called energy gap and we\ncall it energy band gap ok. We call it energy band gap ok, that is how\nenergy band gaps are formed in semi conductor. I can that was a energy verses distance in\na in a splitting of a diagram, but actually what it happens is that I can say that this\nis one fully filled band, this is fully filled band, it is full of electrons it is full of\nelectrons. And then there is a band sorry which is empty\nwhich is empty. This is electrons here; this empty here; it\nis a gap here. This gap is called the energy band gap. And energy band gap is symbol by EG, this\nis energy band gap. So, thank you for your time. We will meet in the next class."}, "5RvKv1im7bY": {"video_id": "5RvKv1im7bY", "title": "Equilibrium carrier concentration", "transcript": "Welcome back. So, we shall continue with our\ndiscussions today. If, you recall in the last lecture what are the things that we studied?\nWe have covered already Fermi Dirac statistics, the probability of finding electron in a semiconductor;\nwe also discussed density of states that is how many states are available for electrons\nto occupy? I told you that you know the product of this density of states and Fermi function,\nthere actually product represents, how many electrons or holes will actually be there?\nWe also introduce the concept of holes by the way right.\nSo, the last lecture was ended with thus discussion on intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductor.\nAnd, I told you, I gave you the expression for intrinsic semiconductor we derived that\nexpression actually for a semiconductor, what is the intrinsic carrier concentration in\na semiconductor which we can express in terms of band gap. It has a lot of actually implications\nfor devices we will come to see that, but we also told that today we shall also do some\nnumericals and try to get simplification of the ideas of the p and n type doping that\nwe have studied ok. How to apply in the numericals, how to actually\nunderstand real world problems? So, those are the things we will cover today. And, if\ntime permits will also go to things like carrier mobility for example, which is very important\nlater on ok. So, let us come back to the last slide of\nwhere we had ended. If you recall this was the slide that we ended right. In the last,\nyou know, I told you that there is an expression for intrinsic carrier concentration, which\ncan be expressed in terms of band gap, right, exponentially in terms of band gap and also\ndepends on N C and N V. If you recall N C and N V are the conduction\nand valence band effective density of states ok. Those numbers are very much temperature\ndependent, there is an expression for N C, there is an expression for N V. We know those\nexpressions, they depend on temperature and effective mass if you recall. And, this expression\nof n i was derived very nicely. I told you, that an intrinsic semiconductor is a semiconductor\nwhere there are no impurities, it is pristine and pure.\nSo, in that case there will always be some electrons and some holes in equal number in\nthe semiconductor, because of thermal energy. For example, in silicon, the intrinsic carrier\nconcentration turns out to be 1.5 into 10 to the power 10 per centimeter cube of both\nelectrons and holes at room temperature ok. I told you that intrinsic semiconductor, n\nis equal to p right, that electrons and holes are equal in number and that is equal to n\ni. So, I multiplied n and p and I got this n i square and n and p can be expressed in\nterms of this right, this particular terms. And so, we got this expression of n i . So, if you recall now I will come to the next\npage now, we will start from here. To make sure that we are not losing track of things,\nI will again it, that the number of electrons in a semiconductor for which, is not very\nhighly doped, is given by n into N C exponential of E F minus E C by K T. This is going to\nbe a very fundamental equation that we will always keep using and using, ok.\nSo, I draw a conduction band and I draw sorry, I draw a valence band. I told you that if\nyou take a middle of line here that is the intrinsic level E i that is always there.\nIf, your Fermi level is in the top half, say for example, if Fermi level is here E F. It\nmeans the semiconductor is n type doped or there are more electrons than holes, and if\nyour Fermi level is in the bottom half, then there are more holes than electrons ok, it\nis p type doped that we know right. So, I told you if a semiconductor is not very\nhighly doped, then this equation holds true ok. This equation holds true and this is very\neasy to actually see N C is a constant right, it depends on temperature and it depends on\neffective mass, it can be calculated, it will be provide in the question. And, it depends\nexponentially on the difference between E C and E F you see, this gap, negative of this\ngap, E F minus E C is the negative of this gap.\nSo, if this gap becomes smaller and smaller, which means the Fermi level keeps coming closer\nand closer; if, the Fermi level comes up like that I am giving in red color, then you will\nhave more electrons. Because, this gap reduces and if the gap reduces, then this minus of\nthis gap know. So, this quantity will increase basically. So, your doping becomes higher.\nOne way to raise the Fermi level closer to the conduction band is to have more electrons,\nwhich means you dope it high. I told you right, there is n-doping, which\nmeans you are adding an pentavalent impurities of things, you have more electrons than what\nyou need, you know each atom will give 1 electron. So, if I for example, phosphorous is a dopant.\nSo, if you add phosphorous atoms, then 1 phosphorous atom will give you 1 extra electron ok.\nSo, if I 10 to the power 10, 10 to the power 15 phosphorous atoms, I will get 10 to the\npower 15 extra electrons. So, that is how I modulate the conductivity because I can\nchange the number of carriers available in the semiconductor for carrying current, that\nis how we do it ok. This equation is going to be very fundamental through out now. So,\nlet us not lose track of this equation. Similarly, for holes we have another equation. p is equal\nto N V exponential of the negative of the gap here, you know. So, it is E V minus E\nF by K B T ok. So, these 2 equations are going to be very\nfundamental. One very important thing to notice here is that these equations are valid when\nthe doping is not very high. And, I told you doping not very high means that this spacing\nshould be at least 3 K T or should be more than that ok. So, this spacing should be 3\nK T or more than that. If, it is not 3 K T or less than 3 K T, then the Fermi level is\ntoo close to conduction band, and this equation will not hold true then you have to use the\nactual Fermi integral ok. Most of the equations and situations in our\nlife will revolve around moderate doping ok. And, that is why this equation will definitely\nhold true ok, this equation will definitely hold true. If, it is a high doping effect\nwe will see that this gap becomes very small and this equation is not holding true. Actually\nfor an intrinsic semiconductor the Fermi level lies close to middle of the band gap, and\nwe multiply the product we got that is equal to n i square and that is how we got the expression\nfor n i. So, let us come to that expression for n i\nnow. I told you intrinsic carrier concentration in a semiconductor depends as N C N V square\nroot exponential of minus band gap by 2 K B T. So, you see it depends on band gap, right,\nit depends also on this quantity and that quantity which is fine. Now, for silicon it\ncomes out to be around 1.5 into 10 to the power 10 per centimeter cube, it is always\nnormalized volume. So, silicon has a band gap of 1.1 e v. What if I take a material\nwhose band gap is lower, say material germanium. Germanium has a band gap of 0.6 8 e v which\nis lower than silicon. If your band gap becomes lower, which means\nif this quantity becomes lower, ok. Negative of the exponent know, if it becomes lower,\nthen this quantity becomes higher right, the whole thing becomes higher. So, basically\nwhat it means? It means that lower band gap material, if your band gap is lower gives\nyou higher intrinsic carrier concentration, ok and, if this band gap is higher, for example,\nif this band gap is higher right. Say for example, I take gallium nitrite, it is a semiconductor\nalso. There are many semiconductors it is band gap is 3.4 e v, which is much larger\nthan silicon right. In that case your if your band gap is much\nhigher then your n i will be much lower. So, what implications does it have? See there\nare different kinds of semiconductors, silicon is one of the most widely used, but there\nis germanium, there is gallium arsenide, all your white light LEDs that you see in the\nmarket and you in your house those are made of gallium nitrite. So, there many semiconductors\nactually, different semiconductors have different band gap. And, because of that different semiconductors\nalso will have different intrinsic carrier concentration right.\nSo, now this intrinsic carrier concentration is the minimum concentration that you will\nalways have in a material. And, under any circumstance you cannot bring it down lower\nthan this because this is thermally generated. So, if you take a semiconductor. If, you take\na semiconductor for example, this is a semiconductor. And, I take 1 metal contact here, I take another\nmetal contact here and I apply voltage, right. The current that I will get and imagine this\nis undoped, this is intrinsic ok, which means this is the purest form of semiconductor that\nyou can get ok. This is the purest form of semiconductor you\ncan get; then, the lowest current you can get you cannot get lower than that ok. The\nlowest current you can get depends on how many carriers are there in the intrinsic condition\nwhich is n i which means, that the lowest current you will get in the semiconductor\nunder any circumstance will be limited by how many free carriers are there at any temperature;\nsay room temperature any other temperature, without adding any impurity, without doping\nit. So, if your back this is the background carrier\nconcentration, this is the background carrier concentration, this is default carrier concentration\nintrinsic carrier concentration you cannot decrease below that. So, if your carrier intrinsic\ncarrier concentration is higher, then this current that you will get is also higher.\nAnd, if your intrinsic carrier concentration is low, then the current that you get also\nis low, which means you know a wider band gap semiconductor like gallium nitrite with\nmuch higher wide band gap, the large band gap, which has much lower intrinsic area concentration\nwill give you a much lower background current, then compare to silicon or germanium; germanium\nwill give even more. Whose band gap is smaller and that is why\nyour n i is higher that is why the background current also will be high. Is it a good thing\nor bad thing? It depends on the application. For example; this will manifest as the leakage\ncurrent in a device like a photo detector or a transistor, you know this, there is something\ncalled a leakage current you know it is not a good current actually it is a leakage it\nis leads to noise. So, that if you have a smaller band gap material like germanium,\nthen your leakage will be higher. For example, germanium for germanium, n i is much higher.\nI forgot the number exactly, but for germanium I think the n i was almost because it has\nlower band gap know. It almost like 10 to the power 14 per centimeter cube close to\nthat, ok so, that is a very large number. So, what it means is that your lower band\ngap material like germanium for example, will lead to inherently higher leakage current\nin devices. So, that is a very important technological you know statement actually because we design\nthe devices based on the band gap. So, is very important to have that. So, this is one\nthing that we learn from there, ok. Now, let us take things 1 by 1 slowly, will\nnot rush things ok. So, let us get the concepts again much better here. So, for example, I\ntake a condition here. So, remember what I what are this E C and E V, if you remember\nI will be keep drawing I will keep drawing this E C and E V very repeatedly now. Remember\nthat 1 to 1 equivalence E C and E V this is actually comes from e k diagram only this\nis except this is x in centimeter ok. So, this is this line basically represents\nthe bottom of the conduction band in that e k diagram over position it is flat ok, over\nposition it is flat basically it is a constant band gap material like that, that is what\nwe mean ok. This is the actually this is the valence band which is filled up right and\nthis is the conduction band which is nearly empty. So, that thing actually comes, but\nI do not represent this all I just give it a straight line that is it that is how we\ndevice engineers do that ok. Now, if I suppose tell you that I have N C\nof say 3 into 10 to the power 19, that is the number that is given ok. N C is the conduction\nband effective density of states. And, I told you that I have doped the material you know\nI can add doping, and I can increase or decrease, I can increase the conductivity, where I can\ntune the conductivity. So, external dopants are added know in a silicon for example, phosphorous\nis a donor that will give you electron I told you. So, the donor density is always represented\nby N D. It means the density of it means the density of dopants that you are adding right\nor density of donors that you are adding ok. How many donors you are adding? Ok.\nAnd, N A represents to how many acceptors you are adding for p type doping ok, density\nof acceptors. I told you already, if you recall that atoms like phosphorous which can give\nelectrons like phosphorous or arsenic they give electrons to silicon, they donate electrons\nthat is why they are called donors and these are basically n-type doping, they lead to\nincrease in electrons and acceptors like boron for example, they are able to accept one electron\nand give a hole out. So, they actually are p type doping because they lead to higher\nholes ok. So, N A is the density of acceptor and N D is the density of donor . So, now,\nI tell you for example, if I take you a case I will just read out this case again. So, for example, I have conduction band here,\nI have valence band here ok. And, I tell you that you see N C is given to be 3 into 10\nto the power 19, this is a at room temperature, it changes, with temperature by the way ok,\nthis is fixed number per centimeter cube. And, then I tell you that I have doped the\nmaterial with phosphorous N type, N D is equal to for example, say 10 to the power 17 per\ncentimeter cube ok, 10 to the power 17 per centimeter cube, that is the number of phosphorous\natoms I have added. So, that is the number of electrons basically that I am getting extra.\nSo, what is the position of the Fermi level within the band gap. The question is inside\nthe band gap what is the position of the Fermi level? Now, because this is N type dope you\nimmediately know that Fermi level will be in the top half, in this half region it will\nbe there know. What is the exact position of the Fermi level? In other words, what is\nthe difference between the position of the Fermi level will be somewhere here. What is\nthis E C minus E F, can you do that, that is an equation we have know, I told you n\nis equal to N C exponential of E F minus E C by k T.\nSo, here you see if I take this n by N C then I can take a log, natural log here and that\nwill become E F minus E C by k T. I can bring the k T here actually. So, E F minus E C,\nE F minus E C, the negative of this gap is given by actually this quantity which is k\nT is 0.026 e V ok. 0.026. that is the room temperature into log of n by N C. I told you\nN is equal to N only right. Because, that is the number of doping you added and that\nis the number of electrons you are going to get. So, that will be 10 to the power 17 by\n3 into 10 to the power 19. So, you can take a log of this number know\nwhat will be. I do not have a calculator here, but you can do log of 10 to power 17 by 3\ninto 10 to the power nineteen. So, this is like log of 1 by 300 only. So, some negative\nquantity will come, of course, will be negative know this is E F minus E C. E F minus E C\nwill be negative because this is the gap. So, you can do that and you will find out\nsome number. So, it might come out I do not know you have to do a calculator, but may\nbe it comes out to be say 0 point say around 2 e v may be I do not know it may be wrong\nit may be 0.3 also I am just telling you. So, this will be 0.2 e v right, because they\nhave negative of that right. That is how you solve a problem, what is the position? And,\nif your position is given then you can back calculate and calculate this term N D right.\nSimilar thing can be done for holes . So, that is an important thing. Now, for example, now the important thing\nis that I told you about n i, I already told you about intrinsic carrier concentration,\nI told you about this doping and how you know we can do this simple numerical, there are\nsome conceptual questions that the textbooks do not talk about. So, while I am in the topic\nI will tell you also those, there are some conceptual questions ok. You see this band\ngap that is there this within this band gap. Actually, this is a forbidden gap ok. Because,\nsee this is a forbidden gap, why do you know it is a forbidden gap, because I told you\nthis is actually filled with electrons and this is nearly empty, but you can get extra\nelectrons here which can move, this is a forbidden gap. So, carriers cannot exist within this\nband gap, within this band gap, you cannot have carriers because, this is forbidden gap.\nSuppose you have a Fermi level here ok. Suppose, you have a Fermi level here, the Fermi level\ntells you that there is a 50 percent chance of finding electron here, at the Fermi level,\nif you recall Fermi Dirac. The question is, if electrons and holes cannot exist within\nthis band gap, it is a forbidden gap ok. Then, how come there is a 50 percent chance of finding\nthe electron here, does it mean there is a 50 percent chance of actually finding a electron\nhere right. The solution to the paradox is that Fermi level is only a statistical construct,\nit makes lives easier to understand many of these things ok, it is not a real level here.\nWhat it means is that of course, electrons cannot exists within the band gap. Within\nthe band gap electrons will not exist, but, here it means that there is a higher probability\nof finding electron here, you know than finding a hole here for example, ok. So, it means\nthat there is a 50 percent chance of finding here. it is the statistical construct that\ntells you how close you are to finding the electron in the conduction band, it is what\nis the probability here? So, there is higher probability you will find lower probability\nwill find hole or stuff like that. So, it basically gives you a number as to\nwhat is the probability? And, this probability itself will not tell you electrons will be\nthere or not. I told you there is density of states also, you remember density of states.\nSo, only density of states times the probability both has to be multiplied, both has to be\nmultiplied only then you will get the number just because there 50 percent probability\nhere does not mean you will find a electron here. Because, the density of states is 0\nhere. 0 multiplied by probability 0, you need to have some density of states and density\nof states are only here. So, basically you have to multiply both together.\nSo, one of them alone cannot tell you/ fifty percent probability does not mean there is\nan electron ok. It is a probability times the density of states that will give you the\nexact number of electron, same with holes. So, this is one thing they may not many may\nnot tell you so much. Another thing the people often do not tell you is that you see I we\ntypically draw a conduction band and then valence band. Of course, there is an intrinsic\nlevel at the middle at the middle of the gap, this is half way through. And, suppose this\nis N type dope material or even p type. So, n type will be say Fermi level is here right.\nSee these are straight these lines are very straight right if you recall these lines are\nvery straight right, whenever there is a straight line what does it mean? It mean actually it\nmeans there is no field. I will come to that very quickly now. You see the Fermi level\nhere it is straight, the Fermi level has to be flat, Fermi level has to be flat in equilibrium.\nWhat does it mean? It means that there cannot be a slope in the Fermi level. Your Fermi\nlevel cannot have a slope. The moment you have a slope in Fermi level\nit means current is flowing. So, in equilibrium when I say equilibrium there is no current\nflowing, your Fermi level has to be same because the probablity the electrons has to be same\neverywhere. If the Fermi level is tilting, for example, I go back here I will go to new\npage may be you know. Suppose, I have a conduction band here, valence\nband here, and then I say that Fermi level is like this. This is not possible in equilibrium.\nThis will mean it is non-equilibrium, why, because, you know a slope in the Fermi level\nthis is the slope know. A slope in the Fermi level implies that there is a current that\nis flowing. And, if current is flowing then it means there is non-equilibrium.\nSo, your Fermi level cannot have a slope ok. The Fermi level has to be straight that is\n1 very important thing, in equilibrium. Of course, if it is non-equilibrium, then Fermi\nlevel can have slope ok. So, please keep it in mind, many of the textbook do not tell\nyou that ok. Another thing that textbook do not tell you\nis that, if you have a conduction band and valence band that are flat; Fermi level may\nbe here, p type dope material may be, if these are flat there is no slope right, no slope,\nthis has also no slope right. Of course, they are same band gap there is no slope. It means\nthat what does it mean it means that there is no electric field in the material, there\nis no electric field in the material ok, there is no electric field in the material. Because,\nif there is a slope; that means, that the potential is changing basically. And, if the\npotential is changing then the field also will come, right, because this energy are\nactually reflecting their potential only. So, a flat profile means that there is no\nfield ok. They have sense of field that is what it means. Because, if you recall from\nhigh school, field is nothing, but the negative of the slope of potential, you remember that,\nit is a gradient of the potential. And, this energy band diagram that I keep drawing, this\none know, this energy is actually energy of the electron. This E C E V whatever we draw\nknow, energy bands. This energy bands actually represent the energy of electron ok. These\nrepresent the energy of electrons. And energy of electrons is given by you know what negative\nof the charge is there of course, times V, V is the potential. So, potential time the\nnegative of charge electron will give you the energy of the electron.\nSo, essentially this will become 1 by q d E C by d x. So, if the bands are flat, then\nthe derivative of that is 0 know. So, the field is 0. So, whenever there is a slope\nin the electric field, slope in the energy band sorry then you know the electric field. For example, if I have E C like that, E V\nlike that then; that means, there is a slope; that means, there is a field here ok. This\ncan be or cannot be in equilibrium, because I have not drawn the Fermi level here. I have\nnot drawn the Fermi level here this is x here by the way ok, but this is slope means that\nthere is a field, whether equilibrium or nor equilibrium is not a concern right now here\nok. So, now let us take I am trying to solve some\nsimple questions. So, that know things become more and more clear. So, that is one important\nthing. Now, suppose I have, let us suppose I have\nsilicon 2 pieces of silicon, there is 1 piece here; E C E V exactly there is one here, another\npiece of silicon E C E V. In one, the Fermi level is here, in one the Fermi level is here,\nwhich has higher electron. Of course, this is higher electron. Because, the Fermi level\nis closer to the conduction band this also means this higher electron, it may also means\nthat this is higher doping. Now suppose, now suppose, what I will do is\nthat, this is x the x axis is distance you know that right, this x axis is distance you\nknow that right. Now, suppose I take a piece of semiconductor,\nI take a piece of semiconductor, this is the piece of semiconductor, from this point say\nx equal to 0 this point, and say that length of the semiconductor is say 1 micron, 1 micron\nok, this is this. From this side to that side ok, from this side to that side, I gradually,\nI gradually increase the doping; I gradually increase the doping n type doping, what is\nhappening second, doping the increasing the n-type doping, which means, from this side,\nI am increasing the doping n-type doping gradually to this side, I am doping it more and more.\nFor example, at this side, I have a doping of 10 to the power 16 per centimeter cube.\nI slowly keep increasing 2 into 10 to the power, gradually I keep and here I become\n10 to the power 17 per centimeter cube for example. So, that doping is gradually increasing\nfrom left to right. So, this part becomes more doping, this side becomes less doping\nand gradually it is changing. It is in equilibrium which means there is no current flowing, how\nwill it look like now how will the energy band diagram look like. These are the concepts\nthat textbooks often do not tell you, how will the concept look like.\nSo, for example, the band gap is remain same, doping will not change the band gap right.\nAt least the moderate doping you are talking about. If, it is in equilibrium, one thing\nthat you know is that what, your Fermi level will stay constant you agree, if your Fermi\nlevel will stays constant; that means, I will first draw the Fermi level here. So, this\nis your Fermi level which has state constant ok. sorry. This is your Fermi level which\nis constant. Now, on the left side the doping is lower\nand the right side the doping is higher. If you recall, the E C minus E F this spacing,\nE C minus E F this becomes smaller for higher doping and larger for smaller doping. So,\non this side this is the left side right, x equal to 0 this is x equal to 1 micron.\nAt this side the doping is lower right. So, your E C minus E F will be at some positions.\nSo, here 10 to the power 16 scale this is here, this is E C. But now other side, the\ndoping has increased. So, your E C will be closer here than here right ,you agree, the\nyou know the E C will be closer there than here.\nSo, what will happen is that your conduction band will bend like this. And, your valence\nband of course also will bend like that, because the band gap has to remain constant. If one\nbends the other has to bend otherwise the band gap will not remain constant know this\nspacing the gap will not remain constant. So, what it means? It means the Fermi level\nis here sorry, Fermi level is here, it is a constant 1 line, I am very bad at drawing\nthis is Fermi level E F. And, your conduction band has been drifting like this changing\nlike that, why because this position is far. So, less doping this is low. So, higher doping\nok, conduction band valence band will go like that.\nNow, you see there is a slope there, is a slope in the conduction band, slope in the\nvalence band, it means that there is a field. A slope in the conduction band means that\nthere is a field for field experienced by electrons, slope in the valence band means\nthere is a field experienced by the holes. So, of course, both electrons and holes now\nthey have a same band gap of course. So, electrons and holes will experience a field, which way\nwill the field be do you know. See, if there is a concentration gradient\nof see there is 10 to the power 16 electrons here, there is 10 to the power 17 electrons\nhere, then there is a concentration gradient, you agree. So, there are more things associated\nwith this actually, will come to that, it is called diffusion. If there is a concentration\ngradient of species, then you will always the it always tries to go from the higher\nconcentration area to the lower concentration area right. If you spray deodorant in one\ncorner of the room, the particles of the deodorant are highly concentrated in that corner.\nSo, it will diffuse through the corners where it is low. So, the whole room will start after\nsome smelling that deodorant after some time right. So, electrons also try to diffuse from\nthe higher region, from here it will try to diffuse from here right, it will try to diffuse\nfrom here to this side it will try to diffuse. Because, electrons are higher concentration\nhere lower concentration here, but that will lead to a flow of current know, if electrons\nmove. So, that current is balanced by this electric field that is there, electric field\nwill not allow that to happen ok. So, I will tell a little it more about electric field\nhere before we go to the next concept. So, if your conduction band looks like that,\nthis is your Fermi level ok. And, then your valence band looks like this, there is a slope\nhere that I agree, which direction is the electric field do you know, a very easy way\nto find out which direction the electric field is, I told you if there is a slope there is\na electric field. A very easy way to find out which direction the electric field is,\nis think of this of this as a concrete floor a slope like that right. And, you think of\nan electron here as like a cosco ball or tennis ball, it will try to roll this side know,\nwhich means electrons will try to move in this direction. Because, it will rolling in\nthis direction not diffusion ok. This is the drift actually this is rolling\ndown, which means the field will be in this direction because electrons will move opposite\nto field. So, that is how we quickly find out which direction is the electric field\nok. Now, this is a separate case I will come to this very quickly in sometime, but you\nknow this is a case the people do not talk about mostly in textbooks, as to the field\nexistence of field can be inferred from a slope in the band diagram. Fermi level has\nto be flat, if this Fermi level has the slope; that means, there is a current is flowing\nok. Now, these are with doping by the way. And,\ndoping is very essential to increase or decrease the number of electrons or holes and that\nis how I, you know, we change the conductivity of the material by tuning the electron or\nhole density. If, it is of course, undoped then n i is that n i that we talked about\nand n i expression has been there. So, n i depends exponentially on band gap, it is also\ndepends exponentially on temperature right. Now, the question is there is something called\nmass section law actually, balance section you know in a way. So, what happens is that,\nfor example, I told you that for moderate doping, n is equal to N C e to the power E\nF minus E C by k T right. And, then you have p equal to N V e to the power E V minus E\nF by k T right. And, this is not intrinsic, ok, this is not intrinsic, I am talking about\ndoped, I am talking about doped material for example, not intrinsic not intrinsic.\nSo, if I multiply n and p, I get N C N V into e to the power minus E C minus E V by k T,\nright, which is nothing actually, but if I take a square root here take a 2 here then\nI can take a square here this quantity is actually n i. So, the product of p and n will\nalways be equal to n i square at equilibrium, this is a very fundamental rule ok. The product\nof p and n will always be equal to n i square it is a rule ok, it is a fundamental rule\nunder equilibrium it will always be true. So, what does it mean? It means that suppose\nI have a material, I have a semiconductor silicon which is say n type doped, with say\n10 to the power 17 per centimeter cube of doping, this is a donor atom right. So, this\nis donor doping which means so many phosphorous atoms have been put actually or arsenic atoms\nhave been put. So, so many electrons also will get. So, the number of electrons actually\nis equal to this right. So, how many holes will be there? How many\nholes will be there? In this material, how many holes will be there, naturally holes\nwill be lower in number know, because I have added more electrons here, donor will give\nyou electrons. So, these many number of electrons are there. Whatever number of dopants you\nhave added, that many number of electrons will be there that is what we are you know\nassuming till now that is ok. How many holes will be there? You know n i\nfor silicon is 1.5 into 10 to the power 10 per centimeter cube and I told you this p\ninto n will always be equal to n i square, which means p will be equal to n i square\nby n, which means that will be 1.5 will be how much, this square will be how much 2.25\ninto 10 to the power 20. And, n i n is n n is given to be this 10 to the power 17. So,\np will be equal to 2.25 into 10 to the power 3 per centimeter cube, you see the number\nof hole is 10 to the power 3, number of electrons is 10 to the power 17, huge difference you\nknow. So, that is why it is called, you know, n\ntype dope semiconductor there are more electrons than holes, but see the number 10 to the power\n17 electrons and 10 to the power 3 holes. Because, there so, many so, few holes this\nis called minority ok. And, this is called majority, this is called majority electron\ndoping. So, if you dope n type the electrons become majority and the holes become minority,\nyou agree becomes minority and becomes majority. And, similarly if you dope p type if I instead\nof this if I put a p type doping then the holes become majority and electrons become\nminority ok. So, let us wrap up the lecture here today\nlet us wrap up the lecture here today. We have discussed about doping we solved very\nfundamental simple problems of doping, I told you, few things that the textbooks generally\ndo not tell you ,one is that your slope in the Fermi level means that the current is\nflowing it is not on equilibrium. So, if a device or material is in equilibrium, Fermi\nlevel cannot have a slope which has to be straight. It is all with respect to the position\nby the way and conduction band and valence band, a slope in their profile means there\nis a field I told you how that field comes right.\nSo, if and there can be equilibrium or may not be equilibrium we do not know, but a slope\nin conduction and valence band definitely means there are fields there ok. So, I told\nyou about intrinsic carrier concentration, how it depends on band gap, how it also has\na role in or devices, because leakage current will be high or noise will be higher. For\na photo detector for example, made of lower band gap material, then compared to higher\nband gap material. Because, the intrinsic carrier concentration is the base line, the\nminimum carrier concentration that you will have you cannot go lower than that ok.\nAnd, I told you that you know just now I told you here that x, your electrons and holes\nhow you calculate the number. If your doping n type, then electrons are majority holes\nare minority and vice versa. p into n will be always is equal to n i square. So, if you\nknow the n i you can always calculate p or n if the other value is given. I also told\nyou that, you know if you dope it n type the dopant is called donor because it is donating\nelectron and p type dopant is called acceptor because it is accepting electron and giving\nyou holes basically right. And, I told you that if you had 1 phosphorus atom, you get\n1 electron that always need not be true in need not hold true.\nSo, those things we will come in the next class, incomplete ionization incomplete ionization\nand little bit more advance on this before we go to mobility and scattering, which I\nalready introduced in a briefly, the diffusion thing I told you all those things will depend\non mobility also the drift and diffusion ok. So, will come to that before that we will\ncover a few of the slightly more advanced things, but with examples and numericals;\nso, that we will take up in the next class. Thank you."}, "7lx7p03jFKU": {"video_id": "7lx7p03jFKU", "title": "High doping effects and incomplete ionization", "transcript": "Yeah  welcome back. So, we had concluded the last\nlecture with temperature dependence of carrier density. If you recall, we also had discussed\nabout charge neutrality so, the total positive and negative charge has to be same in a semiconductor.\nSo, now, we shall go ahead and we shall wrap up this discussions with a few notes you know\non things like high doping incomplete ionization and then will move to things like mobility\nand drift diffusion so that we can discuss about current transport.\nOnce we discuss about current transport, we can discuss devices like p n junction that\nmakes the LEDs, photo detectors, solar cells, BJTs and so on. Things like MOSFET and different\nkinds of transistors, optical devices everything can be understood when we understand how electrons\nflow and that is carrier transport and primarily governed by drift and diffusion sort of a\ntransport ok. And for that we need concepts like mobility and velocity. And before understanding\nmobility and velocity, we need the concepts of carrier concentration, how they change\nwith temperature, you know conductivity and so on. So, that is what we are doing it. And\nif you recall from the beginning of this course, we had actually covered basics of band gap,\ncarrier concentration and reciprocal space and now we are building up to the carrier\nstatistics, how carriers are distributed and how we calculate the carrier density things\nlike electron and hole density and so on. So, now today we shall focus on high doping\neffects and incomplete ionization, and we shall thus conclude the initial section of\nthe few lectures on carrier density, carrier recombination or carrier statistics and you\nknow density of states and so on; so, that we can move to devices ok. So, today we shall\ncome to the whiteboard now and will get start get started high doping effects ok. So, if you recall in the last lecture, we\nhad in the last few lectures we have talked about you know n type and p type doping. And\nhow do we dope them by adding impurities, we know that now. This equation is very you\nknow very very familiar to you exponential of E F minus E C by k T. So, you know I told\nyou that this Maxwell Boltzamann equation is valid when your E F and E C, this gap is\nmore than, at least more than 3 k T right. At room temperature, this is around you know\n78 milli electron volt. So; that means, it is slightly moderate or\nlighter doping and this equation is valid under such circumstance and you can use this\nformula to calculate the electron concentration you know N C very well. I told you that if\nyour doping keeps increasing, then your fermi level keeps going up and up right ,n type\ndoping and if your p type doping increases, then your fermi level keeps coming down and\ndown. So, if I dope it relatively higher ok; if I dope it relatively higher, such that\nyou know your fermi level, your fermi level comes very close to conduction band. So, that\nthis gap this E C minus E F, this is very close. So, this is less than 3 k T.\nFor example at room temperature 3 k T is around 78 milli electron volt, but if I dope it very\nhigh so that your fermi level comes sufficiently close to conduction band such that it is less\nthan 78 milli electron volt. Say you know, if I say that E C minus E F, this gap you\nknow this gap is suppose only say 50 milli electron volt at room temperature which is\nless than 3 k T, then this equation of Maxwell Boltzmann equation cannot be applied you know,\nwhy? Because this Maxwell Boltzmann equation came if you remember from this equation equal,\nn equal to N C the fermi half dirac integral remember and this expression can be actually\nsimplified to this particular expression, exponential only when the doping is light\nor when you know your E F minus E C, this gap is actually more than 3 k T.\nSo, if it is more if it is higher, less than 3 k T its doping is very high. So, if the doping I am talking about n type,\nsame will apply for p type also, if doping is too high right. If doping is too high which\nmeans say for n type what it means is that your sorry your E F, your E C minus E F this\ngap has become less than 3 k T right. That is called high doping effect. And for p type,\nit means that your E F minus E V has become less than 3 k T, right. So, in this case your\ndoping is very high, you cannot apply Maxwell Boltzmann equation to calculate n and p. What\nyou do is you use know you that expression was there know n equal to N C, this you try\nto sort of do an approximation of this for high doping because calculating this exact\nintegral will need you a MATLAB or mathematica kind of software and it is little also complicated.\nSo, can we do some simplification. So, that is an approximation called Joyce-Dixon\napproximation. Joyce-Dixon approximation, and this Joyce-Dixon approximation will basically\nhelp us to calculate the carrier concentration when your doping is high. Suppose I am you\nknow I am giving a practical problem when your conduction band and your fermi level\nare very close, I tell you that this distance is only 50 m e V ok. What do you do now? How\ndo you find out n? I tell you that N C is equal to say 10 to the power 19. How will\nyou find out n now? So, if you recall, E F minus E C by k T is\ngiven by ln right of n by N C if you recall that right is given by n by N C. That is your\nMaxwell Boltzmann equation actually. This you know the expression that I have written\nin the previous slide, sorry this equation I have written. This is the equation actually,\nI am writing it in a different way, same equation I am writing in a different way. So, this\nis the expression right. For Joyce-Dixon, you add just one more term. You know what\nthe term is, you add one more term and that term is plus, I will use the blue color 1\nby square root of 8, n by N C. This is your Joyce-Dixon approximation that you can apply.\nWhen a doping is high so that your E F minus E C is less than 3 k T. If you can you can\nuse this approximation and you can calculate n.\nFor example, you see that this is a transcendental equation. It is in the form of log x plus\nsome constant term x right. So, it is a transcendental equation. Finding n directly you will you\nwill have to do some numerical and iterative process, but it still can give you a better\nidea. So, for example, if I tell you that E F minus E C is equal to 50 meV, then how\nwill you solve this equation, right? So, it is very easy to solve now. So, I have told you that E C minus E F is\n50 meV which means E F minus E C is minus 0.05, right that is 50 meV is 0.05 right.\nSo, Joyce-Dixon approximation says that E F minus E C by k T equal to ln n by N C plus\n1 by square root of n by N C, ok. So, you know I assuming hundred percent ionization.\nSo, whatever n type doping I am giving is equal to n only I saying right. There is no\np type doping. So, you can replace this n with N D also not an issue. Now this quantity,\nyou know this quantity, I can write as minus 0.050 and k T at room temperature is given\nby 0.026. So, this is roughly around minus 2, not exactly, but close to minus 2. This\nis equal to log of n by N C plus 1 by square root of n by N C. So, this N C is supposed\nto be given in the question. So, suppose it is 10 to the power 19 right sorry. So, it\nis given to be 10 to the power 19. So, now there is only one unknown. This is\nequal to minus 2 right close to minus 2. So, it is only one unknown. So, you can actually\ndo a couple of iteration or even put numerical solver and find out what is n, right, so,\nthat is good. Same thing can be done for p type also. So, this is the high doping effect.\nSo, when your doping is high, right when your doping is high, you have to apply Joyce-Dixon\napproximation to find out the carrier concentration and another thing is if you keep doping higher\nand higher, then your fermi level keeps going up and up know. So, suppose this is your conduction band,\nthis is your fermi level valence band. If you keep doping high and high eventually the\nfermi level can actually almost touch the conduction band, very high doping. In such\ncase we call it is a almost degenerate doping ok. So, super high doping. I am talking about\nn type only, but same will apply for p type also; in the p type fermi level will touch\nthe valence band. So, here you see, the fermi level will almost touch the conduction band.\nIt can even go above the conduction band you know; it can even go above the conduction,\nthe fermi level can be above the conduction band also, if you dope it extremely high,\nthe conduction band might actually come below the fermi level. If it is doped extremely\nvery high if it is doped very high know very high doping, you know what will happen? Couple\nof things will take place actually. One very important thing is that your band gap of the\nmaterial will slightly shrink or reduce. When you dope very high, your band gap will\nslightly reduce. So, for example, silicon band gap is 1.1 electron volt. If you dope\nit very high; suppose you dope it n type say 10 to the power 20, this band gap will now\nbecome smaller slightly. It may I do not know exactly how much it I mean I forgot the value,\nbut it will become slightly smaller; it might become 1 electron volt or it might even become\nyou know 0.9 electron volt. Do you know why? Because, with very high doping with extremely\nhigh doping you are putting too many of substituent atoms into the crystal that distort the lattice\nand your you know periodicity gets also distorted to some extent. The periodic potential that\nyou have and you actually have you know this you have this periodic potential.\nIf you remember the atom atoms are all equally spaced apart right and when you dope it is\nactually like one in a million. So, you know out of one million silicon atoms only one\nwill be replaced by say phosphorous, so, phosphorous. But, if you dope very high, then you know\nthere will be more phosphorous for example, so, what happens is that the periodicity is\nsort of distorted and also that effects the band gap. So, you have things like band tails,\nband tails, which means the distribution actually extends below that you know band gap also. So, for example, if you have to many doping\ndopant atoms; if you have too many dopant atoms if you have too many dopant atoms, then\nbecause you are distorting the periodic potential or you know you are distorting the periodic\narrangements of the atoms your what is what should be this E C and E V actually becomes\nlittle bit you know what it becomes is that, it becomes little bit jagged like it becomes\nslightly like this E C E V. The band gap is always same at any point which\nis reduced slightly, but it becomes little jagged or little because this perturbation\nin the periodic crystal that will manifest itself as a not completely smooth conduction\nvalence band over a position. You know, there will be periodic there will be a like a potential\nfluctuations ok; there will be potential fluctuations that will result in a band diagram like this.\nWe do not have to delete in day to day device analysis, but it just important to know that\nyour, there is a you know there is a there is a fluctuation in the bandage and there\nis something called band tails. So, you know your fermi dirac distribution will extent\nlittle below the band also, will extend below the band also and so, your band gap also will\nshrink, right. Your new band gap E G dash will slightly smaller than actually the true\nband gap of the material. So, there is a lot of interactions between\nelectron-electron and electron and donors or dopants right. So, too many interactions\nare there and all these interactions dopant-dopant interaction. This all interactions increase;\nthis all interactions increase in magnitude when your doping is very high and all this\ninteractions seek to lower the band gap ok. So, this is one effect you should keep in\nmind. You know with very high doping for example, your band gap will slightly shrink that is\none thing we should keep in mind. It is very important you know implications actually later\non in devices and also you should keep in mind that high doping Maxwell Boltzmann equation\ncannot be applied so, you have to apply Joyce-Dixon approximation. There are band edge perturbations\nand so on. So, these are the things that we should you\nknow keep in mind when they are very high doping effects. I told you conduction band\nyou know fermi level, can actually go above the conduction band is very much possible\nis degenerate doping. It is extremely high doping and such high doping material you know,\nyou know are typically not used in many devices, but there will be some devices where you have\nto dope very high. So, it is important to know that and then another thing we would\nlike to discuss before we go to topics of you know mobility and carrier velocity and\nother things which are important for transport is called incomplete ionization. We should just be aware of this term we do\nnot have to do the exact numericals or mathematics of this, but we should be aware of what is\nincomplete ionization. You know I had told probably in a very brief thing some of the\nlast classes may be. I told you that in general, if I am only consider say n type doping, there\nis no suppose p type doping ok; n type doping. I told you that if I add 10 to the power say\n16 donor atoms, say phosphorus and silicon, you know all of them are actually ionized\nwhich means all of them are giving electrons right.\nSo, I will get 10 to the power 16 electrons per centimeter cube, right, electrons per\ncentimeter cube and so, I said that the free electron concentration is equal to the donor\nconcentration, right. This is assuming 100 percent ionization or 100 percent of this\ndonors are actually ionized. And typically they are hundred percent ionized because I\ntold you this is conduction band; this is valence band. And if I draw there is a there\nis a ionization energy level actually, donor energy level say this is E D, the donor that\nyou are putting you know like phosphorous for example, you are putting phosphorous in\nsilicon as an n type dopant. If you do phosphorous in silicon, then this\nphosphorous will introduce a donor energy level which is very close actually very very\nclose ok. This energy difference between E D, the donor energy level and E C is k T or\nless than k T know less than k T which means at room temperature it is sufficient energy\nis there thermal vibration to put all the electrons up in the conduction band. All the\nelectrons are put in conduction band and that is why if you put 100 of this, all 100 will\ngive you electrons that is why, 10 to the power 16 will give you 10 to the power 16;\nsame thing with holes also for valence band. Now, if for some material the doping is such\nthat the donor ionization energy level is not so close, then what will happen? Then\nnot all of them will get ionized right. So, for example, I take E C, sorry, suppose\nI take E V here and then there is a donor ionization energy level E D which is little\nfar away because the donor, the impurity that you are adding is such that it introduces\na donor level little far away. Suppose this is you know 3 k T or may be say 0.1 e V which\nis almost equal to 4 k T almost right. 0.1 e V electron volt is little large four times\nthe thermal energy. So, all the donor atoms that are there I mean not be able to give\nelectrons may be some of them will give electrons some of them will not give electrons. May\nbe if you put 100 of this phosphorous atoms or donor atoms, may be only 60 of them will\ngive electrons rest 40 will not give electrons. So, we see only 60 percent has ionized, 40\npercent has not ionized and the donor energy level is E D. Further away this E D is from\nconduction band more and more it is possible that the ionization fraction has reduced.\nSo, what is the fraction that has ionized? So, I told you typically you know if you assume\nhundred percent ionization, then N D is equal to n which is equal to N D plus because all\nof them has ionized, all the atoms have ionized basically, right. But if it is incomplete\nionization, then this is not true, right, the fraction that is ionized N D plus by N\nD typically it is 100 percent if it is fully ionized, 1 that is 1. But if it is incomplete\nionize, then it will not be 1; it will be something like this, it will be something\nlike this ok. So, the fraction of ionized donors will depend\nas 1 by 1 this is a actually a fermi dirac distribution only, 1 plus 2 into exponential\nof E F minus E D see E F the fermi level comes into picture minus E D, the donor level here.\nThe fermi level will be somewhere here know. So, fermi level minus donor level divided\nby k T, and this factor 2 comes because of spin, 2 states you know the spin. So, that\nis a factor of 2 comes there. So, for example, if I know the fermi level position and if\nI know the donor ionization energy level position, I know that what fraction of donors has ionized\nactually. For example, if the fermi level and the donor\nlevel are the same time, at the same level, E F is equal to E D. So, the fermi level and\ndonor level at the same position then this will become 0, becomes 1. So, it will become\n1 by 1 plus 2, 1 by 3. So, 33 percent of donors will be ionized if fermi level is equal to\ndonor ionization energy level right. So, only that similarly for holes I mean this is an\nimportant thing actually not everything has to ionize similarly for holes. N A minus by N A this is the fraction of holes\nthe not fraction of holes the fraction of acceptors that are ionized. Remember, when\nthey ionize they give a hole or take away electron so that have become negatively charged.\nThis is the fraction that is ionized, that is given by 1 by 1 plus 4 exponential of E\nA minus E F here. This is the acceptor ionization energy by k T. The reason this 4 comes because\nof heavy hole and light hole and then there is a spin so, 4 ok. You remember that for\nsay n type doping, your electron, only if you have a electron n type doping, then the\ntotal electron, the negative concentration has to be equal total positive concentration.\nThis will always be true for an n type dope material ok. Even if it is incompletely ionized\nit is always true, these N D plus need not be equal to N D if it is not 100 percent ionized.\nSo, n will always be equal to N D plus, but whether all the N D plus comes from N D some\nof them may not have come from N D. If it is 100 percent ionized, this will be hold\ntrue. If it is not 100 percent ionized, this will now whole true. So, say 60 percent ionized\nor may be 50 percent, but this will always hold true same thing with holes ok. This will\nalways be true, but this need not be true, this need not be true. So, that you know that\nwe should keep in mind. So now, if you have you know, I told you that\nif you have both electron and hole doping, then the total positive charge is this, total\nnegative charge is this. This will always hold true except that this and this need not\nbe 100 percent ionized, need not be 100 percent ionized. They can be incompletely ionized\nalso. So, for example, you know you have seen the\nwhite LEDs that you can buy from the market, you can buy white LEDs for 100 rupees or so.\nThis white LEDs are actually in fact, blue LEDs and this blue LEDs, they have a phosphor\ncoating they, have a phosphor coating to convert the blue light to white . And this blue LEDs\nare always made up of gallium nitride. It is a semiconductor. All the white LEDs that\nyou see in your parking garage, on the streets, in the airports, in your houses, to stadiums\nall the white LEDs are actually made of gallium nitride semiconductor. And actually a gallium\nnitride p-n junction, a gallium nitride p-n junction will actually be the white LED that\nis what is happening. There is little bit more to it not telling you right now. But\nthat is what is happening will talk about p-n junction later. Why I am telling you this,\nbecause in gallium nitride, p type doping, for p type doping you have to add magnesium.\nThe moment you add magnesium to gallium nitride, you can dope it p type. This magnesium is\nvery less ionized. You know what, only 1 to 5 percent is ionized as a p type, which means\nif I add 10 to the power 17 magnesium atoms, only 10 to the power 15 holes I will get.\nIt is so low and that has implication in the gallium nitride p-n junction which has implication\nin the white LED. So, these are important things that we should keep in mind. So, incomplete\nionization is not something very fancy that we have to study only for our course. It is\nvery important for practical devices like white LEDs, right. So, we should keep that\nin mind. So, now we have finished up many things see.\nGoing from the beginning, we have defined semiconductor bands right. We have defined\nreciprocal space. In this course, I am just taking a stalk here ok. We have defined reciprocal\nspace and things like Brillouine zone. Why they are important? I have told you how band\nenergy bands are formed and energy band gap is formed right, how energy band gap is formed.\nIf you recall the periodic potential, the periodic arrangement of the atoms, periodic\npotential right so, how energy band gap is formed. And I told you about things like effective\nmass of electrons, how the entire quantum mechanics is captured in the E-K diagram and\neffective mass comes from there. Electrons going from valence to conduction band leaves\nbehind a holes. So, I introduced the concept of hole, absence\nof electrons, ok. These are things we had studied initially, then we came about density\nof states to tell us how electrons and holes will populate the number of states that are\nthere, also it depends on fermi distribution, fermi dirac statistics. And from there, we\nwent to how to calculate carrier, n and p carrier concentration. Those we have discussed\nhow to calculate carrier concentration, what is doping, right. We have done that and what\nare the other things we have done in the course till now. We have done about how temperature dependence\nof carrier concentration, temperature dependence of carrier concentration, n and p. I have\ntalked about high doping effects right, high doping effects, talked about incomplete ionization\nwhich is very important by the way; incomplete ionization by the way in high doping effects.\nWe have discussed about band gap narrowing, you know band gap can shrink in high doping\neffect, there will be band tails, we have discussed about things and how you applied\nJoyce-Dixon approximation to calculate charge density and so on. These are the things that\nwe have studied. Now, what is the next point in the agenda?\nThe next point in the agenda will be to introduce mobility, mobility of carriers ok. Mobility\nof carriers, low field transport, ok, low field transport and after that, will introduce\nhigh field transport, high field transport and velocity, carrier velocity. So, low field\ntransport, high field transport will come along with that, what will come is drift and\ndiffusion, drift and diffusion of carriers will come. So, that we can understand electron\nor current, you know current flow. We can discuss current flow. This transport, how\nelectrons and holes are transporting depends on the transport drift and diffusion, they\ndepend on velocity, they depend on mobility right, current will flow and once we discuss\nabout current flow before that also we have to discuss about carrier recombination and\ndecay. how carriers decay. Why they decay? We will talk about that carrier recombination\nand decay, and then will talk about continuity equation continuity equation.\nSo, this is the cycle that will complete in the next perhaps 2 or 3 lectures. We have\nto complete this mobility of carriers, low field transport high field transport, drift\ndiffusion, current flow, then recombination carrier decay, continuity equation. Now after\nthat, we are ready to go to p-n junction and devices. So, that is the agenda here. So,\nwe will wrap up the class here today and in next class we will again look at will start\nfrom mobility of carriers . So, will end the class with the note that we have done high\nfield transport and incomplete ionization. Today we are good we are confident and familiar\nwith carrier statistics, how to calculate electron and hole concentration. Now we shall\nstart to study mobility and low field transport from next class, ok. You might have heard\nthe word electron mobility a lot ok. We will understand what the electron mobility actually\nmeans ok. So, we will end the class here.

My name is Digbijoy from Center\nfor Nano Science at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. So this course, Fundamentals of\nSemiconductor Devices which I will be offering now is actually a course that will introduce\nyou to the basics of semiconductor and semiconductor devices. What are the benefits of doing this course?\nYou will learn right from the very basics of electron holes to designing devices. You\nwill, you will learn everything that you need to know to understand semiconductor devices. You might be aware that most of the electronic\nthings that you see around you, you know laptops, computers or cell phones, anything, they are\nall build of things like transistors, diodes, you know many of the laser diodes, L E Ds,\nsolar cells these are all semiconductor devices and in many cases we are not very familiar\nas to how these devices are working. Although we do make circuits, analog and digital\ncircuits but we do not understand exactly how semiconductor devices are working. So\nthis course will build you the base for understanding semiconductor from the very fundamental, you\nknow level. And after you do the course, you will be confident\nin understanding and analyzing any kind of semiconductor, electrical or optoelectronic\ndevices including compound semiconductor-based devices, silicon-based devices, optical devices\nlike L E Ds, solar cell, photo detectors, photo sensors and so on besides the conventional\ndevices, Ok. And we will start with the assumption that\nyou only have studied physics till 10 plus 2. You do not have to understand anything\nbeyond that. So we will start from there and over the next\n30 lectures that are there in this course, we will, step by step, each of this device\nconcept, the fundamental of semiconductor so that you are able to score very well in\nsemiconductor related courses or entrance exam papers like GATE or other exams. At the same time, you would be also inclined\nto take up career as a researcher in semiconductor either in academy or industry or take up higher\nstudies because the world today needs fundamental breakthroughs in semiconductor technologies\nfor the next generation electronics and photonics. So this course will train you for that. This\ncourse will train your thinking for that and the concepts below that will all be highlighted\nand elucidated very clearly, Ok.

Thank you"}, "W-VN6D3aSqo": {"video_id": "W-VN6D3aSqo", "title": "Fundamentals of band structure", "transcript": "So, if you recall in the last lecture which\nwas the first lecture of this course, we had introduced the concept of semiconductor, and\nwhy semiconductors are very essential in today\u2019s world. And we also introduced the concept\nof bands, energy bands, how bands are formed. We also introduced the concepts of reciprocal\nspace and E-k diagram, but we shall revise that once again today. So, the main the main\ntake home lessons we learned last time was that number one semiconductors have a unique\nproperty which is that you can tuned your conductivity between you know metals and insulators\nsort of you can do many order of magnitude change in their resistance by adding impurities\nor by doing some other techniques which is not possible in metals or in insulators right.\nSo, an another thing number two is that they have a gap between the highest occupied band\nand the lowest unoccupied band and that gap is called energy band gap which is not too\nhigh unlike insulator, and in metal there is no gap right. So, semiconductors have these\ntwo very important properties. And since semiconductor is a solid; it is a crystal right. So, many\nof the properties will depend on how the crystal is, and it is as much as material sciences\ndevices and we shall learn subsequently in the course that we have to study both the\nmaterials physics as well as the device aspect together to understand how the devices work,\nhow technologies are made ok. So, we shall come back to the whiteboard again.\nLast time I had told you that energy E and momentum are related by this relation if you\nrecall h square h bar square k square by 2 m. What was k here, k actually is a reciprocal\nspace vector, but you can visualize it as momentum because h bar times k gives you the\nmomentum right. So, you can think of k as momentum, it is a momentum direction. And\nenergy depends in a quadratic relation to momentum. This actually this comes from high\nschool physics only p square by twice m is equal to kinetic energy if you recall right\nthat actually what it comes from. This all was valid for a free electron in\na space right an electron free in space, where there is no you know no boundary no crystals\nnothing. In that case energy and k has a parabolic relation right like that. And we call that\nyou know this is a parabola of course, and energy and k has this parabolic relation and\nthat\u2019s very good we learn that. Now, I told you that when an electron move in a crystal,\nit sees this periodic atoms right there is a periodic arrangement of atoms in 3D, here\nI am drawing it only in 2D ok. Here I am drawing only in 2D; sorry I will\ncome back to the page again. So, there is these atoms which are arranged\nin 3D, and an electron has to go through the crystal when an electron moves in a semiconductor.\nWhy are we studying this, we are studying this because we want to eventually understand\nhow current flows in semiconductor right. We want to understand eventually how current\nflows in semiconductor. And why do you want to understand why current flows in semiconductor,\nbecause only then we can understand different devices like LEDs, MOSFETs and so on right.\nSo, how current flows in semiconductor, we need to understand the transport of electricity.\nAnd current is carried by electrons; and another type of particle called holes, I will come\nto that. So, we need to understand how electrons actually\nmove in a crystal. Now, a semiconductor to be actually a semiconductor and have a band\ngap, it should have this periodic arrangement of atoms which are highly periodic in nature\nok. In any direction you look, the crystal structure will look the same. It is called\ncrystalline material unlike a piece of glass or wood or you know like some oxide where\nbasically you have an amorphous sort of a structure where the crystal these atoms are\nnot arranged in a definite lattice ok. So, we are talking about semiconductor crystal.\nSo, we can assume that these are periodic actually these are periodic in a periodically\nthey are arranged, and each of these atoms actually introduces a potential right, each\nof these atoms introduces a potential. And it is called a periodic potential . It is\ncalled a periodic potential. So, essentially an electron has to move in\na periodic potential, it has to move in a periodic potential. And that periodic potential\nis set up by the atoms it right, all the atoms that are there in the crystal, setup this\nperiodic potential and electrons have to move in the periodic crystal. So, when electrons\nmove in a periodic potential in actually a semiconductor crystal like say silicon, then\nthis E-k diagram that we have drawn know this E-k diagram if you remember this is E, this\nis k, this E-k diagram that we have drawn becomes a little bit distorted. It becomes\na little bit distorted when electrons move in a actually a periodic crystal ok, periodic\npotential ok, it\u2019s not in free space. Only in free space electron has this E-k relation\nwhere energy is proportional to k square. Actually this diagram means that as we increase\nthe momentum of a electron, the energy will increase parabolically with respect to the\nmomentum that is basically what it means right. So, and you remember that there was the h\nsquare k square by 2 m there that m was the mass of electron we say right. In free space\nthis is the mass of free electron, and you know that mass of free electron is m naught\nactually which is given by 9.1 into 10 to the power minus 31 kg right, but this mass\nactually is the mass of electron when it moves in free space.\nNow, I told you that when electrons will move in a periodic potential in a semiconductor\ncrystal, then first thing that will happen is that this E-k diagram actually becomes\ndistorted and that is mathematically can be proved. We shall not derived that expression\nhere, but you can mathematically prove that you this E-k diagram becomes distorted. And\nso when the electron moves in the periodic crystal, if you can try to visualize this\nphysically if is not mathematically so much, when an electron moves in this periodic potential,\nthen it sees that periodic potential along with variation know. So, the electron experience\nas a difference sort of acceleration, it experiences you can say that it has a different mass inside\nthe inside the periodic potential. So, I told you that this different atoms if\nI take a one-dimensional string of atoms only right, this atoms will introduce you know\nthey have a own potential. So, I told you that they actually introduce a potential wells\nlike that right. And this potential profile can be actually modeled by a very simplistic\nargument you know like people do that kind of a this is suppose a ok, this is again a,\nthis is like a lattice constant. Remember a is the spacing between adjacent\natoms, it is called lattice constant. Spacing between adjacent atoms ok, adjacent atoms,\nit\u2019s call lattice constant. It is also called lattice constant. So, so you have this infinitely\ndeep potential well, this is infinity you can assume, this is infinite. And these are\ndelta functions. You know where essentially you are electron, the nuclei of the atom slide,\nthey are like delta functions, they are delta spikes and you have this periodic potential.\nSo, you solve the equations you know like you solve the equations basically of an electron\nas it moves inside a periodic potential that\u2019s what you do. You have to solve some quantum\nmechanical equations; we are not touching in those in this course. But if you solve\nthat, then you will find out there actually this E-k diagram ok, this E-k diagram becomes\ndistorted. How does it become distorted you know I will draw it a better picture.\nSo, what did I tell you I told you that when the electron actually you can model the periodic\npotential of atoms as this infinite quantum wells with delta function of this , they are\nall a here. And you have to solve the motion of electron inside the inside this periodic\nquantum well or periodic potential well ok. The motion of electron, when an electron moves\nbecause electron is a subatomic particle, now it basically has both electron and particle\nand wave like nature. So, to understand the motion of electron, you have to solve an equation\ncalled Schrodinger\u2019s equation ok, you have to solve an equation called Schrodinger\u2019s\nequation. It was actually derived and proposed by Erwin Schrodinger; he was a physicist in\nthe 1920s. He got the Nobel Prize at a very young age for doing this pioneering work.\nSo, a Schrodinger\u2019s equation is actually an equation that basically equates the energy\nof electrons in a way, and there is something called a wave function psi. We will not going\nto the details psi is actually call a wave function. And it basically just like you know\nif you throw a stone in a pond of water, you have this waves right. So, you can model the\nelectron also as a wave in and there is a wave function associated with it ok. You know\nthat it is impossible to exactly find out the location of electron, and determine it\u2019s\nvelocity of momentum simultaneously right that is Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\nSo, what you can do is always, you can give a probability of finding the electron. You\ncan always give a probability of finding the electron. You can never guarantee and say\nthat this is where the electron is you can only give a probability. And apparently psi\nof x ok, it is modulus whole square gives you the probability of finding electron ok.\nSo, this is a wave function of the electron. And you have this Schrodinger\u2019s equation\nactually depends on this wave function of the electron.\nYou solve that you know for a free space, then you get the E-k diagram of also you know.\nAnd if you solve it for this periodic potential, where there is this periodicity of this potential,\nthen you can get the actual Schrodinger\u2019s equation solution for an electron inside a\nsemiconductor crystal which is periodic in nature. And as I told you, it has to be periodic\nonly then the concepts of energy band gap actually can be used right, so that is why\nanother reason why it has to be periodic by the way. So, you if you do that, then you\nwill see that the E-k diagram actually becomes distorted. So, what was the E-k diagram; before let me\ndraw it again. So, this is E ok. What I keep telling as E-k diagram actually is an energy\nmomentum diagram in a way you can think of it. So, initially the E-k diagram was something\nlike this, my drawing is not very good, but it is a parabola a very nice parabola. But\nthis is in free space when in periodic crystal the E-k diagram becomes distorted in the sense\nthat it will have a shape here like almost like that, but after sometime it will become\nlike that ok. It will open up. And there is a discontinuity here, there is a discontinuity.\nSo, again it will start from here not doing it very well sorry I made it any ways. So,\nit will again start from something like that. It will again start from something like that.\nSo, there is gaps that appear here right, there is gaps that appear here. My drawing\nis not very good, but of course, they are symmetric. So, you have these gaps here. And\nif you remember thus the in free space, it is a smooth parabola like this; it is a smooth\nparabola like this no discontinuity. But in a periodic potential, there has this\ndiscontinuity that is discontinuity because if you consider this first band here, first\ncurve here, it has a band here there is a gap there is a gap here you see, there is\na gap here you see. And this discontinuity, this distortions you know that deviation from\nthe smooth parabola happens, this actually it is like that actually it here and here\ndoes the same point actually by the way ok. This is the same point; this is the same point.\nThis all happen at spacings of pi by a, 2 pi by a, whatever you know then again there\nwill be destruction at 3 pi by a, here similarly minus pi by a, minus 2 pi by a and so on ok.\nYou have these distortions actually. You know a is the lattice constant of the\ncrystal which means the spacing between adjacent atoms. So, you know that. So, pi by a is of\ncourse, the unit is centimeter inverse by the way. So, every pi by a, 2 pi by a, 3 pi\nby a, n pi by a, you know you have this distortions that come out ok. And this is the actual shape\nof the E-k diagram for an electron that moves in a periodic potential. And you can see that\nthis first lowest level or even the higher levels, they are not exactly parabola, they\nare parabola towards k equal to zero point, this is k equal to 0. But as you go away from\nthe k equal to zero point, your deviation occurs substantially, and it is no longer\nparabola, it becomes little curved, other way around right. So, the curvature changes\nthe curvature changes. And to understand now why are we studying\nall these. You have you have to always ask this question as to why are we studying the\nE-k diagram of electrons that are moving in a periodic potential because electrons move\nin actual semiconductor crystal when they carry current. And this E-k diagram is very\nmuch there we cannot see it physically, but it is actually there. And this relation you\nknow the energy and momentum relation of electrons is most fundamental in understanding the transport\nproperties, in understanding the band diagram in understand in making designing devices\nso many things ok. It is very fundamental to understanding the electron transport in\na semiconductor crystal that is why we are understanding.\nThere is a lot of physics that has gone into it, lot of Nobel Prizes have been awarded\nyou know on this, but we shall actually talk about it very simplistically not going too\nmuch of mathematical details that\u2019s what I am trying to do here. It so happens that\nmost of the semiconductor devices that we learned or we will study in this course whether\nthat is BJT, MOSFET, LED, photo-detector, does not matter, we can always consider everything\nto be happening or we can basically understand everything by understanding this first block\nhere. We do not have to go to this we do not have to go to this ok. These are higher order\nyou know we can say zones, you can only consider between minus pi by a to pi plus pi by a ok,\nonly this particular zone, of course, this is here. So, let me draw it again ok. All the semiconductor transport, all the devices,\nall the concepts of physics and transport everything can be understood only in the first\ngap here. So, this is k ok. And I told you this is pi by a; and this is say minus pi\nby a right. So, it will be something like that right. I told you so little deviated\nfrom parabola. Of course, they are higher order bands that start here, but we will not\nneed that so much ok. This zone that I am talking about within plus pi by a, minus pi\nby a is called the first Brillouin zone ok, Brillouin zone. This is a scientist actually\nname Brillouin actually he made this things, so first brillouin zone.\nSo, this is the first zone where sorry this is the first zone where most of the electrons\nactually will be there, and most of a device transport physics will also happen here ok.\nThis is the E-k diagram of a real electrons that are moving inside semiconductor crystal\nthat is one number one thing. Number two is that this is not exactly a parabola. This\nis a slight nonlinearity as you go away from 0 to pi by a. When I say you go from 0 to\npi by a, it is not physical distance you are going by the way 0 to pi by a, your k is changing,\nit means your momentum is increasing. So, at k equal to 0, your momentum is 0, but\nat here the k the momentum as become some finite number. So, when you increase the momentum\nessentially you have this non parabolic sort of relation eventually ok. And this essential,\nbut most of the things you know this you can see that this is energy on the y-axis. So,\nthis point is that higher energy than this point. Most of the electrons will be close\nto here only ok, very low energy we can we talk about low energy. And so at close to\n0, it is perfectly parabola ok. If you can say, it is a very nice parabola at close to\nk equal to 0. And mostly we will talk about k equal to near 0 only ok.\nSo, this is the energy and you can say this is like a you can say this is like a band\nof course, where electrons are populating. Electrons will populate as you have more electrons\nwe will start populating more, but we will mostly have we will concern only about near\nk equal to 0. So, this is actually E equal to h square k square by twice m still holds\ntrue for this particular distorted parabola of a real semiconductor crystal when electrons\nmove except that is m is no longer the free electron mass that we are talking about in\nspace this m has a special meaning now. This m actually we call it m star ok, and it is\ncalled the effective mass ok, it is called effective mass of electron. So, effective\nmass of electron means what is the mass of electron as it experiences when it moves inside\na periodic potential in a semiconductor crystal ok. And it is mostly different from the free\nelectron mass ok. So, another way of looking at it is that if\nI write E equal to h sorry h bar square k square by twice m, and then I take a derivative\nof E with respect to k ok, the slope of E-k diagram then I get what h square by into k\nby m star right that is the derivative. Now, we take another derivative d square E by d\nk square, what do you get, you get h square by m star.\nSo, what I can write is if I can write it again here right, I can write m star as equal\nto right h bar square divided by d square E by d k square. So, what does it mean actually,\nyou know if I take a E and k diagram, and I told you this looks like this for example,\nthis is pi by a, this is minus pi by a, of course, this line does not exist, this is\nmy testing ok. So, you know d E by d k is basically the slope, but d square E by d k\nsquare is called actually what you know it is called curvature it is called curvature\nof a plot or diagram ok. So, essentially h square essentially h square which is constant\ndivided by the curvature of the E-k diagram that ratio gives you the effective mass that\nactually tells you the mass of electron as it moves inside a crystal.\nNow, h square is constant. So, forget about it. So, basically the mass of an electron\nas it moves inside a crystal is actually inversely proportional to the curvature of the E-k diagram.\nSo, the energy and momentum has a relation this energy and momentum has a relation. The\ncurvature the inverse of the curvature ok, the inverse of the curvature is proportional\nto the mass. It may not makes physical sense to you right now. What we will try to see\nwhat physically it means. One thing is that this E-k diagram comes from actually a quantum\nmechanical solution I told you Schrodinger\u2019s equation and everything has to be solved to\nget this exact thing. So, the number one thing that is there is\nthat because you define the effective mass as you know h square by d square E by d k\nsquare. And I told you that this comes from proper you know quantum mechanics this E-k\ndiagram right, and the Schrodinger solution right Schrodinger solution it comes right\nthat E-k diagram. So, essentially when you define effective mass like that, this effective\nmass, this effective mass concept takes into account takes into account, what does it take\ninto account, it takes into account the band structure information of the material, the\nband structure information on the material on the particular material you talking about. This E-k diagram that I told you that E-k\ndiagram that I have been telling you here. This E-k diagram actually it is sort of a\nit is actually it is called a band structure this E-k diagram it iself is called band structure.\nHow energy of electron changes its momentum that is actually call band structure. It comes\nfrom quantum mechanics. I told you it is very heavy physics. But the entire band structure\ninformation is actually condensed and you know crisply put into this d square E by d\nk square expression. So, when you have this effective mass defined\nthis way, you do not have to solve any quantum mechanical equation separately. This particular\nexpression of the derivative second derivative of the E-k diagram takes into account entire\nphysics and quantum mechanics that is inside that is inside the band structure. So, what\ndoes it mean? It means that all the classical sorry all the classical physics equation all\nthe classical physics equations. For example, you know f equal to m a that is the Newton\u2019s\nsecond law of motion right; for example, acceleration times mass is force. All these classical physics\nequation can be applied now can be applied to electron.\nSee electron is a subatomic particles, quantum mechanical properties have to be included\nwhen we study transport of electron, because electron is a subatomic particle. And you\nknow the Schrodinger\u2019s equation has to be inherently used all this becomes highly mathematical.\nAnd in day-to-day understanding of your devices, if you understand a LED for example, how an\nLED works, or how a MOSFET works that makes your transistors you know processors, your\nIntel everything. If you want to understand all these day-to-day devices, then solving\nthe Schrodinger\u2019s equation or doing a quantum mechanical analysis every time becomes tedious.\nIt will need supercomputer and all these things. So, lot of mathematical work.\nBut if you can apply classical physics equation like f equal to ma you know thinks like that\nvery simple equation you know then life becomes easier. So, all classical physics equation\ncan be applied two electron, all though ideally you should not be able to apply classical\nif you try to understand classical physics equation should not be applied or cannot be\napplied to subatomic particles like electrons, they can only apply to bigger particle microscopic\nthings like a like a table, a chair, a cosco ball a football and all these thing you can\napply classical. But you talk about electrons and you know\nall this things subatomic particle you should not be able to apply classical physics equation.\nBut because you have taken all the quantum mechanical information in d square E by d\nk square, we can use classical physics equations to electrons in semiconductor crystal as long\nas we use as long as we use effective mass effective mass. So, as long as you use effective\nmass ok, as long as you use effective mass, you are going to include the quantum mechanical\ninformation inside this particular term which you do not have to solve or do anything, it\nwill be given ok. So, as long as you use a effective mass, we\nare free to use classical physics equation on a subatomic particle like electron and\nstill get fairly accurate results or mathematical understanding of the devices. So, this is\none beauty of the E-k diagram that it condenses all the information into this, and then it\nallows you to use the very simple high school classical physics equation even on particles\nlike electrons that is the beauty of the equation ok. Now, these things you do not have to solve\ntypically this effective mass will be given. For example, the effective mass of electron\ninside semiconductor crystal for example gallium nitride is a semiconductor, and effective\nmass of electron inside the crystal will be 0.2 times the effect the free electron mass.\nSo, it actually lower in a way; it can be higher also. But for example, you know you\nknow you know this in a material like gallium arsenide, it is another semiconductor that\nis used to make your very high speed transistors, your effective mass of electron will be 0.06\ntimes free electron mass. So, this particular information this particular\ninformation basically captures all the quantum mechanical picture you do not have to bother\nabout it. So, as long as we use m star equal to 0.20 m naught for gallium nitrate for example,\ndifferent materials have different effective masses by the way ok, different materials\nhave different effective masses of electron that is one thing. So, as long as we use these\neffective masses, you can freely use classical equation to understand the electron transport\nthat is the beauty ok. Of course, I told you different materials\nhavr different electron effective masses. And another thing is if you take a crystal\nfor example, if I take this hexagonal crystal of gallium nitride right, I keep telling you\nthis if I keep taking this you know crystal then it is possible that whether you are looking\nat this direction or whether you are looking at this direction your effective mass may\nchange which is what to say the effective mass can be anisotropic.\nYou have a crystal right. You have a crystal semiconductor crystal, but whether you are\nlooking towards the top you are looking towards the side, your effective mass might be different\nin different material. It is called anisotropic effective mass. It is not universal. Some\nmaterials may not have that property; some materials may have that property. So, what\nI am saying is if you take a wafer semiconductor wafer like that right, whether you are looking\nat a transport this way like there is a metal pad here, there is a metal pad here looking\nat transport this way, or you have a metal pad here and metal on the back side. So, the\nelectron is moving in this direction. Depending on whether is lateral or vertical\neffective mass might be different; it is called anisotropic effective mass. We will not consider\nit here, but it is made even possible that in effective mass might be anisotropic. For\nexample, in silicon you have different direction and you can have different effective masses\nok. I was take you telling you here number one thing right. What is the number two thing;\nthe number two thing is that for effective mass ok. The number two thing for effective\nthese are important concepts that is why I am spending time to understand that. Number two thing I told you that it is it\nis inversely proportional to curvature. So, suppose I have a material whose E-k diagram\nwhose E-k diagram say looks like this. And then I have another material E-k diagram.\nSuppose, this is suppose this is one material semiconductor x, and this is another semiconductor\ny ok. Now, this E-k diagram here, it looks like this it is also parabola sort of thing,\nbut it looks like that. You can see that this has a higher curvature does not it looks like.\nIt has a higher curvature, because it is curving sharply here. And this is a lower curvature;\nthis is a lower curvature right. I told you the effective mass of electron m star is inversely\nproportional to the curvature right is inversely proportional to the curvature ok. So, if this\nas a higher curvature, then this means this material will have a what it is higher curvature\nknow, it will have a lower effective mass ok. What I am trying to say is that of course,\nyour E-k diagram can keep changing although it will looks almost like parabola, but it\nis very possible that you know sorry it is very possible that one material has an E-k\ndiagram which looks like this very high curvature. And another E-k diagram has a material which\nE-k diagram looks like this sorry ok. So, the curvature here is high very high curvature,\nthe curvature here is very low. So, if you have a higher curvature, then effective\nmass will be higher curvature will have low effective mass; and lower curvature will have\nhigher effective mass. Now, you may ask so how does this effective mass being higher\nor lower matter it matters tremendously it matters tremendously in your devices. If your\neffective mass is low, if your effective mass is low, then there is something called mobility?\nI will come to that may be few classes later. There is something called mobility of electron\nthere is something called mobility of electron. If your effective mass is low, then mobility\nof electron is high. If you have a higher electron mobility, then\nyou get higher current. You get higher current in a device, you get superior transport, you\ncan carry very high current densities very useful for high power, high speed electronics\nfor example so you want a low effective mass material. You do not want a material with\nhigh effective mass. So, this E-k diagram actually this E-k diagram actually tells you\nso many things right. See it has a lower curvature right, because it has a lower curvature it\nhas a high effective mass right and that is why it is this material will basically slow.\nIt will also be carrying lower current it is not a good material right. So, this kind\nof things can be inferred for making devices from the E-k diagram so that is a very important\nconcept we have learnt. So, what do we learned so far that electrons\nmove in a periodic crystal and because they move in a periodic crystal their parabola\nis distorted. And because their parabola is distorted, you have you know this E-k diagram\nthat that basically fragments into different distorted forms. So, you have something like that; then like\nthat right, high order bands keep coming. I said the first look at the first zone here\nit is called first Brillouin zone between minus pi by a to pi by a. And most of the\nphysics and most of the electron transport will consider only this band. So, we called\nas the first Brillouin zone B-Z Brillouin zone we first considered the first Brillouin\nzone. And we confine ourselves to the discussions here ok.\nThere are many things associated with a periodic potential, how to solve the Schrodinger equation,\nand the periodicity of the potential also helps solving the Schrodinger\u2019s equation\nby putting some boundary conditions there are things like block oscillation, block equation\nlike this because of this periodicity that comes there you know you can you can put the\nsome boundary conditions there. We have not you know covered those these are\nnot very essential from this course point of view, we have this course is actually does\nnot need a prerequisite. So, we cannot going too much details here, but you know the first\nzone basically will be enough ok, the first zone will be enough to understand all the\nphysics all the devices that we will talk about in the course.\nSo, I told you the curvature of this zone E-k diagram very importantly basically capture\nthe effective mass of the electron, and it is not exactly a parabola. It is slightly\nit is not a parabola, but close to 0, it still a parabola and the effective mass can be derived\nfrom the second derivative, so that we know and the effective mass is huge role to play\nin how you device the devices you know design the devices. So, that is very important. And\nI told you the effective mass can be different in different directions in the same crystal\nin some materials right. Effective mass values typically it is a lowered\nand the free electron mass and space. It can also be a higher in certain materials it is\nall depend on the crystal structure in a way right. So, this is quiet essentially about\nthe E-k diagram was. And now going ahead we shall introduce a very fundamental concept\nactually, the very fundamental see we were talking about electrons right. We are talking about electrons. Remember this\nis E-k diagram, but I will if I talk a realistic diagram I told you in the last lecture you\nknow there is a conduction band here which is nearly empty if you recall and then there\nis a valence band here. I told you how bands are form a free if you recall you remember\nhow bands are formed do you remember how bands are formed. These bands are formed when discrete\nenergy levels of atoms they split into continuum of many, many discrete levels when you bring\nthe atoms close together. And eventually when you have large number\nof atoms coming close together to each other to form a crystal, then this discrete energy\nlevels will form into a band ok. It looks like a band. And this band is completely filled\nwith electrons. This is mostly empty of electrons, but there is a gap here between them two it\nis called the energy band gap we denote it with EG right, and then this is called energy\nband gap. It is a fundamental material property of every semiconductor. Every semiconductor\nhas a band gap. This band gap it is gap between this two can have values that you can range\nfrom 0.1 eV or even lower to even up to 6 eV.\nThe lot of range of band gaps available, but typically semiconductor like silicon have\na range of say one point as a value of 1.1 e V right, 1.1 electron volt is a energy separation\nbetween the fully field conduction valence band and the empty conduction band. You can\nactually excite this is filled with electrons. You can actually excite electrons from here\nto here to here you can put, and this electrons are now free to move because this band is\nempty. So, energy states are empty. When the energy states are empty, electrons\ncan easily move if it is packed here, then electrons cannot move right. If it is packed\nwith electrons, then how can they move they cannot, but here this is empty? So, if you\ncan excite electrons from here, then the electrons can move and that is how they can carry current.\nAnd this electron movement in the conduction band was what actually we had described in\nthe E-k diagram right, the E-k diagram and I am not a very good drawing person, but this\nis E-k diagram it is a it is you know. And this E-k diagram this particular energy\nthat I had drawn this band you know what this band actually is a conduction band ok, is\nactually the conduction band, is actually the conduction band which is this. This is\nin real space the x-axis is distance in centimeter ok. This is in reciprocal space x-axis is\nk momentum which is centimeter inverse you can say right, this is centimeter meter. So,\nthis is real space. This is conduction band right. And this is actually what I had drawn\nhere. This E-k diagram actually replace the conduction band in the K space which in real\nspace the straight line here of course, right. So, that is actually how you relate it.\nThis energy band gap by the way changes with temperature it is very strongly depend on\ntemperature. Now, if you increase the temperature, decrease the temperature, this will shrink\nor become you know large and so on. Now, the most important thing that I will introduce\nvery quickly and as you going to the next lecture now we will stop and we will going\nto the next lecture, but the next lecture we will discuss about what happens when electron\ngoes from the conduction band the valence band which is fully filled goes from the valence\nband to the conduction band where it can carry current.\nWhen it goes what it what does it leave behind it leaves behind a hole, electron has gone\nto conduction bands so it leave behind a hole. So, that concept will introduce in the next\nlecture after this. And from there we will take forward to the statistics and how electrons\nand holes are distributed in the bands, and then we are ready to understand devices ok.\nSo, here we end the class."}, "2m6FRf235mM": {"video_id": "2m6FRf235mM", "title": "Band structure (contd.) and Fermi-Dirac distribution", "transcript": "So if you recall in the last class we had\ndiscussed about E-K diagram and I told you that in a real semiconductor crystal the electrons\nwill face this periodic potential of the atoms, that is why the E-K diagram becomes distorted\nand thus E-K diagram has a huge impact on how we understand devices; because the effective\nmass of electrons as it moves inside a crystal is dictated by the curvature of the E-K diagram.\nSo, it is very important hope you have you know recalled all those things. I told you\nin the last class while ending that I have introduced the concept of holes because that\nis as important as electrons ok. So, today we shall introduce the concept of holes and\nalso the statistics that dictate how electrons and holes are populating in this energy bands\nok. And it is a very crucial concept you will see electrons and holes are equally important\nin semiconductor research. So, let us come back to the whiteboard here. I told you that the conduction band here I\nwill call C B conduction band and then there is a valence band here V B this is completely\nfilled with electrons this is completely filled with electrons ok. And because it is completely\nfilled with electrons, electrons do not have any empty states to move. So, it cannot carry\ncurrent, but this is nearly empty. So, you can actually excite an electron somewhere\nhere somehow you excide either by giving heat or by light or something excite some electron\nthere, then this electron is actually free to move and that is how they carry current.\nAnd you can tune how many electrons you can excite or how many electrons you can have\nhere and that is the beauty of semiconductor I keep telling you because in metals or in\ninsulators it is very difficult or you cannot do that ok.\nSo, now we will keep in mind there is something called E K diagram we will not forget that\nbecause that is very important. Now when I take an electron from valence band to conduction\nband, it leaves behind a vacancy here you know. If I take one electron away from here\nto there, it leaves behind a vacancy here, that vacancy is called a hole. Actually, hole\nis a absence of electron right hole is an absence of electron you agree right. An electron\nthus move there it left behind an empty space it is a sort of a vacancy. So, that vacancy\nis called hole and hole is the absence of electron. But in semiconductor devices it\u2019s\nmuch more convenient and its it makes sense, if you define the hole sort of a particle\nonly. Although it is the absence of electron you can treat it as a particle and what will\nhappen now? Suppose this is the valance band this is your valance band it is filled with\nelectrons right I will give electrons like this its filled with electrons and also , but\nI will only take. So, one of this for example this, has gone\nto conduction band, it has gone to conduction band it has gone to conduction band lets it\nhas come here that is fine. Now there is a vacancy here, there is a vacancy here. So,\nif you apply a field electric field in this direction; if you apply electric field in\nthis direction which means electrons will try to move in this direction right? If a\nfield is in this direction electrons will try to move in this direction what will happen\nnow? See if this if this was field know if this was field initially, then the electrons\ncannot move because there is no empty state where will they move? They cannot move. So,\nthere is no current. But now I told you that one electron has gone from here and it has\nleft behind an empty space it is like a vacancy it is a hole what will happen now? If I apply\na field in this direction x direction, electrons will move in negative x direction. So, this\nelectron will be able to come here now right and then here it will be a empty space ok.\nBecause electron has the near by electron has come here its an empty space. Now this\nelectron can come here of course, so, because it is an empty space no its a vacancy so,\nit can come here and this will be blank. Of course, the other one can come so, on and\nso, forth so, essentially what will happen is that, you will have electrons like that\nand the hole empty it will keep moving. The hole was initially here, the hole was\ninitially there right. But the hole is moving in this direction, the hole is actually moving\nin this direction in a way the vacancy is moving in this direction because the electrons\nare jumping jumping right. So, coming here right. So, the hole is moving in this direction.\nSo, I can say that the hole is moving in the direction which is in the same direction as\nelectric field, which means it has a positive charge you agree? Electrons are moving to\nthe left electrons are moving to the left because they will move opposite to the field.\nBut because they moving to the left the hole is seems like moving to the right agree? Because\nthe hole is moving to the right it looks like the hole is moving to the right initially\nthe hole is over here. So, the hole has a positive charge because only then it is moving\nin the direction of field ok. So, hole essentially is an absence of electron\nwhich can be modeled as a particle as a positive charge, that moves in the same direction as\nthe electric field ok. That moves in the same direction of electric field and initially\nif everything was packed here no hole you know; then all the electrons are there they\ncannot be movement the total momentum is 0. But now the total momentum is not zero because\nthere is an empty particle sort of it, you know its absence is moving. So, now, this\nis not a total momentum is 0. So, that negative of the total momentum you\nknow that is the hole momentum you can call the hole actually is a is the negative you\nknow is the opposite of electron, but its mass is not the same by the way, its mass\nis not the same because this hole can now we model as also a particle its called a quasi\nparticle, because it is not realistically a particle, but you can model it a particle\nand that makes life easier. Instead of explaining and understanding how electrons are moving\nhere in this way, it is much easier to talk about a vacancy moving to the right a hole\nmoving to the right that makes its simpler. Of course, in conduction when you talk about\nelectron moving because there is all empty you know talk about electron, but here you\ntalk about holes. So, the beautiful thing is that holes also\nhave their own energy band first of all they have their own energy band. And their energy\nband will correspond to the valence band right because they are moving in the valence band\nelectrons are moving in the conduction band; holes are moving in the valance band. So,\nholes will correspond to valance band holes also have their own effective masses, because\nyou can draw the E-K diagram for holes also and that will be valance band right.\nFor example, this is E this is K and I told you the electrons have a E-K diagram like\nthat. Same way holes also can be drawn this is conduction band by the way hole because\nthe hole energy is opposite of electron you know the hole will look like this, this is\nthe hole, this is the hole E-K diagram energy. This is the hole energy and this is K equal\nto 0. An electron energy you know this is E-K diagram of electron as you go up the electron\nenergy increases right here as you go down hole energy increases as you keep going down\nthe hole energy increases. So, at this point at K equal to 0 point the hole energy is the\nlowest as go down it increases. So, this is the, this actually is the valance band and\ntheir holes are here we can say holes are here and this is the conduction band. So, essentially we are talking about E K diagram\nfor both electrons and holes, we are talking about E K diagram for both electrons and holes.\nSo, essentially you have this E, K, K, this is the hole energy here. So, this is electron\nthis is hole this gap sorry this gap is the energy band gap again. Because this energy\nband gap is called Eg I told you. This energy band gap is the same as this conduction band,\nempty conduction band and the fully field valence band this is fully filled some electrons\nwill go here leaving behind holes here and thus electrons will be here right. So, this\nvalence band corresponds to this, this conduction band corresponds to this, this band gap of\nEg corresponds to this this is called this whole thing this whole thing thing whole thing\nis called sorry. this whole thing is called band structure because it is E-K diagram this\nis called band structure E-K diagram and this is called band diagram just the band diagram\nbecause it is in real space ok, but this is the one to one correspondence between the\nsame. So, valence band essentially you talk about hole transport in valence band it\u2019s\nfilled with the electrons by the way, but holes are moving in the valence band and electrons\nare moving in the conduction band right that is what is happening ok. Holes are moving\nin valance band electrons are moving in conduction band, holes are essentially quasi particles\nthey are absence of electrons, that you model as quasi particles they have the own effective\nmass, because this E-K diagram that you are drawing for a hole, same thing that comes\nfor electrons. It also has a curvature know it also has a curvature. So, that will also\ngive the effective mass of hole the inverse of this curvature H square H bar square inverse\nof this curvature, will also give you the effective mass of hole and so, holes have\ntheir own effective mass electrons have their own effective mass and this point ok this\npoint is called the lowest energy point of the conduction band and this is the top most\npoint of the valence band, the distance between them this energy gap between them is energy\nband gap Eg this is K remember this is K, so, this is K equal to 0 this is K equal to\n0. There many important things here, number one\nthing is that unlike in electrons holes are more complicated because they are not technically\nparticle right because they are quasi particle they are model the vacancies are model. So,\nthere is a there is a little thing here a hole might not only has this one branch this\nis one band it might actually have 2-3 sort of it might have 2-3 sort of a we can call\nthem branches of E-K diagram. Electrons that are technically do not have them, but they\nmay typically holes will definitely have this you know mostly have this separate branches\nok. You might see that the curvature of the top\nmost is the lowest the curvature of the topmost is the lowest then curvature increases. If\nthe curvature becomes higher then effective mass becomes lower. So, this is called light\nhole branch the top one is called heavy hole branch why is it called heavy hole? Because\nthe curvature is small let me draw it again may be freshly right. I am only talking about the E-K diagram for\nholes. So, this is E sorry this is K, this is there are three branches typically one\nis this, one is the red one, then one is the blue one for example ok.\nThis red one actually goes to almost K equal to 0 like this and touches and come where\nhere, but the blue one has an offset here there is an offset here the blue and the red\nis an offset ok. So, the black one has the lowest curvature you see. So, it has got the\nhighest effective mass. So, it is called the heavy hole branch, the middle one has a higher\ncurvature, so, lower effective mass is called light hole branch. So, they are different\nbranches of hole actually, and the last one is actually of spin orbit coupling we do not\nhave to worry about it this basically some coupling between spin of the holes and other\nthings. So, it has three branches, but that is fine\nwe can talk about the top branch here and this is how holes actually the energy split\nlooks like and of course, the electron will have only one branch typically. So, electron\nis fine there, and this gives the energy gap that is what we need to know and this is K\nright this is K. You know it is almost like talking about water bubble, you know air bubble\nin a water. So, here water fill and gravity is pulling you this side right gravity is\npulling you this side right, but there is a bubble of air. The bubble will move upward\nagainst gravity the bubble will move upward against gravity right.\nSo, how do you explain that? It is easier to explain if you say that the bubble has\na negative mass. So, that it is acting against gravity is moving up. So, in a filled water\nyou are talking about an empty bubble. Same thing you can talk about a hole a very crude\nanalogy, you can talk about a hole in a valance band that is moving against the you know the\nits actually moving in the direction of the field against in the opposite of the direction\nof the electrons that is how you can talk about it. So, that is one thing and because\nI am in the E-K diagram I am talking about the holes and electrons already, I told you\nthat electrons and holes have their effective masses, they have their own E-K diagram and\nthe separation between them is the energy band gap, there is a one to one correspondence\nbetween the E-K diagram and the energy diagram here. What is more important here to understand\nis that, when I have a E K diagram like this right; and energy the lowest point is that\nK equal to 0, it is not necessary that it is not necessary that one second I will just\nput it here put here, K this is e this is K I told you that you know the hole has the\nenergy like that. Typically will talk about that K equal to 0 point at K equal to 0 point,\nthe hole will have this you know the topmost point of the E K diagram in hole will correspond\nto here, the bottom most point of E-K diagram in electron will correspond to here, but it\nis not necessary that all semiconductors will follow this rule. In some semiconductors in\nsome semiconductors you know that in some semiconductors your bottom most point of conduction\nband need not be at K equal to 0, this is K equal to 0 point right.\nIt need not be K equal to 0 like this in this case it is fine; this point the bottommost\npoint of conduction band, the topmost point of valence band they are the same K point,\nthe energy difference is band gap, but it need not be same that is why I am saying what\ndo I mean? I mean that there can be semiconductors where\nyou have E you have K, K, E. You will always take the hole for hole the valence band will\nalways have the topmost point at K equal to 0 ok, but for electrons you know the conduction\nband may have a point here, but this is not here exactly and then there is somewhere here\ncomes very low and goes at some other K at some other K. So, you see this is the lowest\npoint. This point, this point is lower than this point agree this point is a much higher\npoint no right. This point is at lower point then this, but this is K equal to 0 and this\nis K not equal to 0 this is some finite K we do not know what K is this right. But energy\nband gap Eg; energy band gap is defined between the highest point in the valence band here\nand the lowest point in the conduction band, which means this and this is the gap you are\ntalking about and this is your energy band gap ok. this is energy band gap; you cannot\ncall this as the energy band gap because this is much larger gap than this no this gap is\nmuch larger than this, we have to take the smallest gap.\nThe topmost point in the valence band and the bottommost point in the conduction band\ntheir separation in energy is the energy band gap; not this one and this one. What happens\nhere is that the bottommost point of the conduction band is at not K equals to 0. Because it is\nnot K equals to 0 so, an electron and a hole if they have to do a transition or recombine\nthey have to go this way know it is very difficult not probable why because this change is a\nchange in K and K is momentum. So, essentially for electron and hole to basically make a\ntransition some way to excite or you know absorb light or emit light or so on.\nElectron and a hole has to essentially make this transition across this gap this is a\nmomentum change you know delta K and this change in momentum is pretty huge, you cannot\nelectrons and holes do not have that kind of you know a light particle for example,\na photon cannot give that kind of change of momentum to cross from here to there. So,\ntransition of electron and hole this way is you know it is a process which needs the assistance\nof some other things like atomic vibrations. Because atoms when they vibrate they can give\nenergy and change the momentum, that is how they come go from here to there. There is\na very inefficient process. So, this kind of semiconductor, where the bottom of the\nconduction band and the top of the valence band are not exactly at the same K. These\nare called indirect band semiconductors indirect band semiconductors like silicon for example,\nor germanium for example, and those materials where top of the valence band like I had showed\nyou in the previous slide here, where the top of the top the bottom of the conduction\nband and the top of the valence band and the same K. So, if you want to excite an electron\nfrom here to there, you do not have to change K.\nNo change in K which means no change in momentum right no change in momentum. So, essentially\nif you want to excite an electron from here to there or get a electron hole combine here,\nthe K is only zero here right. So, electrons and holes essentially do not have to change\ntheir momentum. So, very efficient process these are called direct band gap semiconductors,\nand examples are like gallium arsenide right, gallium nitride and so on ok. These are direct\nband gap semiconductor and the semiconductors where E K diagrams are such that, bottom of\nthe conduction band top of the valence band are not in the same K they are indirect semiconductor\nlike silicon. So, transitioning from one point to another point becomes very difficult inefficient,\nyou need to take the help of phonons or which are phonons are actually you do not have to\nuse the word phonons these are actually atoms vibrations.\nAtoms keep vibrating know about their mean position, you can quantify them or you can\ncall them as phonons ok. And those atomic vibrations essentially give energy to the\nelectrons or holes to change their momentum and inefficient process. So, things like indirect\nband gap semiconductor like silicon or germanium, they cannot emit light they cannot they cannot\nemit light why? Because for emitting light you will see the electrons that are here,\nhave to come down and recombine whose holes are here and the energy that is there actually\nreleases photon will see that in light optical processes.\nElectrons that are here and the holes that are here will recombine directly, and the\nenergy that is lost this energy know that is emitted as photon that is emitted as photon.\nAnd that energy that is emitted will be roughly equal to the band gap of course, whatever\nthe band gap is there that is how you emit the light because they will recombine. It\nneeds no change of momentum so, it is a efficient process that is how materials like gallium\narsenide, gallium nitrite can be used to make led because they can emit light, but material\nlike silicon for example, it cannot emit light because an electron that is here and the hole\nthat is here for them to recombine you need the help of atomic vibration to change the\nmomentum. So, that energy lost actually is energy that is given to the atomic vibration\nand hence you cannot emit light it\u2019s a very inefficient process.\nSimilarly, absorption of light in materials like gallium nitride, gallium arsenide is\nvery high ok. The absorption is very high here you know, a photon comes here for example,\nan electron in the conduction valence band can be excited to the conduction band, and\nthat energy is used of the photon energy is the used of which are very efficient process\nso, it is also a very high absorption coefficient. Now silicon and indirect material like silicon\nor germanium also can absorb light, although the absorption coefficient is much lower,\nbut it can be still be absorbed light that is why they have used some silicon solar cells\nfor example when the light comes that light energy the photon energy will be used to excite\nthe electrons from here to there, its a not a very efficient process because part of the\nenergy has to also be given up to the you know the photons will not have enough change\nenergy to change the momentum. So, you have to take help from the atomic vibration anyways\nright. So, you can excide the electrons of course,\nwith taking the help of atomic vibration it is an inefficient process. So, the absorption\nis not very absorption coefficient is not very high unlike in direct bandgap material\nlike gallium nitride or gallium arsenide where the E K diagram is such that, the conduction\nband, valance band and the same case absorption is very efficient there right.\nBut this material like silicon cannot emit light that is one thing. These are called\nindirect band material and this is a very important concept that you should know. But\nboth indirect and direct band material their energy diagram in the real space will look\nlike this only you know you have a conduction band here, valence band here whether it is\na direct or indirect you do not know here because it is a x axis; it is a x axis in\ncentimeter and this is energy this is called energy band diagram and from energy band diagram\nconduction band, valence band you actually cannot tell if it is a direct or indirect\nband semiconductor, but from these diagram you can tell if it is a direct or indirect\nband semiconductor from E K diagram. And that E K diagram actually tells you that is why\nit is very important, whether a material can emit light or not can be told very easily\nvery nicely from the E K diagram ok. So, that is the concept about indirect and\ndirect band gap material ok. So, now, what are things that you have learnt? Tells take\na recap and we go as we go to the next concept. So, one thing that you have learnt is so,\nlet us see from where we have started this lecture, I told you the concept of holes we\nhave introduced the ok so, we have introduced the concept of hole right. So, I told you\nthat electrons can go from the conduction, valence band to conduction band they can leave\nbehind hole, a vacancy and you see if there is a vacancy here then when you apply an electric\nfield electrons move in the opposite direction to the electric field and it seems like the\nholes are moving to the right because electrons keep moving to the left.\nSo, we can treat the hole as a quasi particle which have positive charge that moves in the\ndirection of electric field. Hole also has its own E K diagram I told you holes also\nhave their own E K diagram and that E K diagram of holes actually represents the valence band\nof the semiconductor valence band of semiconductor and the movement of holes is always associated\nwith the movements of holes in the valence band, movements of electrons is associated\nwith movement of electrons in the conduction band, and the curvature of this also give\nyou the effective mass of holes. So, holes also have their own effective mass.\nI told you that holes might actually have three different branches of E K diagram the\nlight hole, heavy hole, and spin orbit curve and the separate bandage here band hole here,\nbut we typically consider only light hole or sometimes may be sorry heavy hole and sometimes\nmay be light hole. They have different curvature this band this separation between the highest\npoint of the valence band and lowest band of the conduction band it is basically defined\nas the band gap. If happen to be the same K and K equal to 0 it is called the direct\nband gets semiconductor and if they do not happen to be in the same position K then they\nare called indirect band semiconductor like silicon for example, that is an indirect band\nsemiconductor. So, it is a very poor you know it cannot emit\nlight, also it is not a very good absorber of light although you can still make solar\ncells by making thick silicon layers. And to make a transition of electron hole if in\nthese kind of material you need the help of atomic vibrations call on phonons, that is\nhow you basically make a the transition between electron and hole its an inefficient process\nand that is why it cannot emit light. And the next immediate concept that we will learnt\nhere in today\u2019s class that is very important is actually how this is we have learned it.\nHow electrons and holes are occupying the energy you know. This is the conduction band for example, and\nthis is the valence band for example, I am talking about the direct band semiconductor\nhere this is E K diagram right, this is E K diagram. How are electrons populating the\nconduction band? How are holes populating in the valence band all this concepts we need\nto understand by using statistics. Why? Because electrons and holes are very\nlarge in number you cannot individually pick up an electron and hole to do that, you have\nto talk about an ensemble like a collection and that is why a statistics comes handy and\nwe have to use Fermi -Dirac statistics here Fermi-Dirac statistics. The Fermi-Dirac statistics\nnothing very fancy I mean there is two people Dirac and then Fermi of course, they both\ngot noble prizes when they were very young and this Fermi Dirac statistics will tell\nyou how electrons or holes will basically you know populate the energy bands and when\nwe study Fermi Dirac statistics, we do not have to think of only electrons it can be\napplied to any particle which has certain properties, you know like in distinguishability\nand other things. So, when we study Fermi Dirac statistics,\nit is not exclusively with respect to semiconductor, but its respect to many type of particles\nyou know it can be applied to many kind of particles which satisfy this you call fermions,\nyou do not have to worry about that so, much now. But how do we actually come up with this\nFermi Dirac statistics to define the statistics of electrons and holes that are occupying\nthis? You know that for we will take a very simple case into account let me do one thing.\nSo, suppose I have many energy states. These are all at energy level E 1, these are all\nat energy level E 1 and there are g 1 states ok. There are g 1 states they are all at energy\nE 1 and the number of electrons that will occupy this is N 1.\nN 1 electrons will suppose occupy g 1 energy states that had an energy E 1 ok. Then similarly\nthere are g 2 energy states at energy E 2, and N 2 electrons have to occupy them. So,\nsimilarly there many right this is suppose g i energy states, at energy E i and N i has\nto be there and eventually you have a large number of thing, eventually it has N N you\nknow N N for example, total number here ok. So, first let us look about this in how many\nways can you; in how many ways I repeat in how many ways can you fill this g 1 states\nby N 1 electrons? It is like saying I have for example, 7 boxes I have 7 boxes and 5\nsay marbles. I need to fill up 7 boxes with 5 marbles in how many ways can I do that?\nI can do that by 7 C 5 which is 7 factorial by 5 factorial 2 factorial if you remember\nfrom high school physics high school sorry maths right.\nSo, the number of ways in which you can fill up g 1 energy states with N 1 electrons is\nactually g 1 factorial by N 1 factorial, g 1 minus N 1 factorial that is the number of\nways in which you can fill up the this states. Now of course, for the second level you can\ndo g 2 N 2 and so on, for i th level it will be g i by N i g i minus N i right it will\nbe like that. So, the total number of ways in which you can fill up all these things\nwill not be the sum, but will be the product. It will be the product of g 1 factorial by\ng 1 minus N 1 factorial N 1 factorial, that is the number of ways about the first energy\nlevel can be filled up; the second energy level can be filled up by g 2 factorial g\n2 minus N 2 factorial N 2 factorial and so on if the product. This like the summation\nis given by sigma, the product is given by pi the product is given by pi.\nSo, if I give sigma it is summation right if you remember. So, instead of summation\nI have to use product, product is given by big pi like that. So, this is basically i\nfor example, and i goes from 1 to large number of N ok. So, the way is to minimize this \nand so, there are certain derivatives and some approximations that have to be used,\ncalled stirling approximation because it is a factorial and then you have to minimize\nthis you know probability eventually. So, what you get essentially is something like,\nyou have to get something like say N i by g i, the number of electrons that you are\nfilling in the number of available states that you have it basically gives you the probability\nit basically gives you the probability that a state is occupied. It is like you have 5\nmarbles, and 7 empty boxes. The probability that a box is occupied is\n5 by 7 you agree? So, essentially you get this probability, this is the probability\nthat an energy state this is the probability that energy state is occupied by electron\nis occupied by an electron it is occupied by an electron that is the probability ok.\nAnd this probability can be obtained by basically minimizing this function doing some approximation\nand simple maths. We will skip that but eventually this expression this N i by g i it is actually\ncall and this is at E i level by the way. So, this is the probability that electron\nis occupying that and it is corresponding to i. So, it is called f the probability is\ncalled f, and this f of E i because this the corresponding to an energy state of E i that\nthese are the number of states these are the number of electrons, but this is the energy\nby the way. And this is actually given by 1 by 1 plus this is 1; 1 plus exponential\nof E i minus E F that is something called E F by K T, this K is not the reciprocal space\nmomentum this K is Boltzmann constant K and T is temperature. So, let us write down it again real its write\nit down again f of E i the probability that this energy state is occupied is 1 by 1 plus\nexponential of E i minus E f by K T this is Boltzmann constant K B T. This is the probability\nthat an energy state is occupied at E i write by an electron and E F here is called actually\nthe Fermi level. You call it Fermi energy when it is temperature T equal to 0 otherwise\nyou call it Fermi level and it is somewhere it is also called chemical potential by many\npeople same thing actually ok. Is the Fermi level and what does this Fermi level mean?\nIt is actually a statistical construct it does not exists in reality, but the difference\nof Fermi level can be actually a realistic quantity wherever a little different it is\na statistical construct it is a statistical construct a statistical concept that helps\nin understanding many things. For example, if your E i the energy that you\nare talking about is E F, then if you look here what will happen? f of E i equal to E\nf you put here E i equal to E f that will become 0. So, E to the power 0 is 1, 1 by\n1 plus 1 is 1 by 2 and this is independent of temperature, does not matter what t you\nhave this is 50 percent. So, you can say the Fermi level is a statistical concept of course,\nit is the energy level it is the energy level where you have a probability of 50 percent\nthe finding the electron of finding the electron right of finding the electron an electron\nok. The probability, the energy level at which there is a 50 percent chance that there you\nwill be an electron that energy level is called Fermi level and it is independent of temperature\nlike this probability of 50 percent is independent of temperature any temperature ok.\nThis is at any temperature at any temperature the probability of finding the electron is\n50 percent at Fermi level. That is your statistical construct or a concept of Fermi level. It\nhelps in understanding so, many things ok. And a Fermi level as you will see will become\nthe most important thing that will go along with you in that semiconductor device analysis\nnone of the device that we will talk about in this course can be understood without Fermi\nlevel everything will be related to Fermi level. So, Fermi level is the statistical\nconstruct that tells you the probability of finding the electron, it is the level at which\nthe probability of finding the electron is exactly 50 percent right. So, what I can do here is that I can plot\nthe probability this f of E right versus E at say T equal to 0 Kelvin. So, at T equal\nto 0 Kelvin if you plot that function I just had drawn know, it will look like this it\nwill look like this ok. This is E F till the Fermi level all the electrons in a it is 100\npercent probability this is 1 this is 0; above Fermi level there is zero percent probability\nthat electrons are there and below Fermi level there is 100 percent probability that electrons\nare there at 0 Kelvin. If I increase the temperature say know if I increase the temperature say.\nif I increase the temperature say 100 Kelvin, then this Fermi Dirac distribution this Fermi\nfunction by the way that in case I had not told you this actually this is a Fermi function\nit is a Fermi function and its its you can call this is a Fermi Dirac probability also\nits also called Fermi Dirac probability that probability distribution electrons in a way,\nyou can find out the probability in any energy level E i told you that at E f at Fermi level\nit is 50 percent, but at any energy level E i you can find out because you know E i\nminus e f, that E i quantity you have to know and temperature of course, you have to know.\nSo, what do I do? So, this is at 100 Kelvin this will become how much how do you know\nthis will become slightly this and this is slightly become this, it is point of course,\nis half this 50 percent. So, at Fermi level you have always 50 percent probability of\nfinding the electron, but now there is a slight probability of finding the electron above\nthe Fermi level also right because in and overall area has remain same, but this has\nbecome slightly deviated and then you have say T equal 200 Kelvin I am raising the temperature\nwhat will happen then? Then to you will have even more like this like this.\nSo, now, you have even more probability that there is a electron above Fermi level to much\nfarer far away energy level you know this is also this has increase so, you have a finite\nprobability of finding the electron above Fermi level also what it means as temperature\nyou know? As your temperature increases as your temperature increases probability also\nincreases that you probability also increases that you will of finding electron above Fermi\nlevel of finding electron above Fermi level. So, finding the electron above Fermi level\nalso increases, the probability of finding the electron above Fermi level also increases\nwhen your temperature increases that is what it means right. With higher temperature if\nyou take for example, T equal to 300 Kelvin then of course, it will be even like that\neven more, but this at any temperature at Fermi level this is E F. At E F you will always\nhave 50 percent probability of finding the electron that is what it means. So, basically\nFermi Dirac statistics will tell you the distribution of electrons and it also you know if I want\nto tell you again if f of E gives you the probability of finding the electron at energy\nlevel E, then one minus f of actually E is the probability of not finding the electron\nso this is the probability of finding holes by the way and this is the probability of\nfinding electrons by the way right. So, the electrons and holes and how they are\ndistributed and how we study them the devices and everything depends on the probability\ndistribution ok. This probability, it is very important that is why introduced the concept\nof Fermi function. Now the another important concept that we probably will introduce in\nthe next class of course, and that will be very important to understand the many of the\nthings I will just briefly mention, what that is here and that is called actually density\nof states. I will not introduce it in this class, in\nthe next class I will come here density of states this is something we will discuss in\nthe next class ok. And together with Fermi function, I told you the Fermi function and\nthe Fermi probability here right. So, witht Fermi function and density of states that\nI will introduce in the next class within combining these two concept, you can find\nout the actual number of electrons or holes, actual number of electrons or holes can be\nfound out by doing this two things. Already I told you Fermi function is the probability\nfunction and density of states is something that will take up in the next class. Density\nof states essentially tells you how many energy states are available per unit energy per unit\nvolume, per unit energy per unit volume how many empty states are there? How many energy\nstates are there? Once you know that density of states and once you know the probability\nthat you can occupy those empty states, the product of these two in a way will give you\nthe actual number of electrons or holes that are there in the semiconductor.\nSo, all the devices will depend on how many electrons and how many holes you have in the\ndevice and for that you need density of states and then you need the probability. So, today\nwe learnt about probability, the probability that an energy is occupied by an electron\nthat comes from Fermi Dirac probability, and Fermi Dirac probability says that at exactly\nFermi level which is a statistical concept you have 50 percent probability of finding\nthe electron. But as you increase the temperature there is also a probability that above the\nFermi level you will find some electron, at 0 Kelvin you have absolutely no chance that\nyou will find electron above the Fermi level ok.\nSo, next class will introduce the concept of density of states from there will take\nit forward ok. So, thank you and will meet again in the next class with density of states\nok. Thank you."}, "tdo_cqP_JnE": {"video_id": "tdo_cqP_JnE", "title": "Introduction to energy bands", "transcript": "Welcome everyone. This energy band gap is\nthe beauty of semiconductor; metals do not have this energy band gap and for insulators\nlike glass actually this energy band gap this energy whole this energy band gap concept\nwill only come when the material is sort of crystalline what is crystalline?\nCrystalline means no matter in what direction you look in a crystal right. So, I told you\nx y z so, these are the atomic arrangement in lattice right. So, crystalline material\nmeans that no matter in which position of the lattice you go it will always look the\nsame which means the arrangement of this atoms as lattice points are always the same there\nis no distortion to this. Everywhere in all direction they will always\nlook the same there is a continuity, there is no local variation of this if somewhere\nit is like that somewhere it is like that its not like that its all uniform ok. And\nthe atoms are arranged periodically the atoms are arranged periodically and this periodicity\nis not violated. So, they are highly periodic in all direction this is the crystal structure.\nAnd only a crystalline material actually has you can define a band gap technically speaking,\nbut even then qualitatively you can assign a band gap to insulators also ok. Like say\nfor example, a piece of glass or a piece of like plastic or wood we they do not actually\nhave a band gap, but we can qualitatively assign and say or even oxide for example,\nyou can take an oxide. For example, aluminium oxide or silicon oxide you can sort of assign\na band gap to this materials and this band gap actually for those materials for this\nmaterials is very high. When I say very high what do I mean? I will\ncome to that this is very high for semiconductor this is not so, high not so high. Again high\nis a qualitative number this thing we have to come up with some quantitative number we\nwill do that we will do that this is not so high for semiconductor and band gaps do not\nexist for metals band gaps do not exist for metals.\nSo, what happens is that I told you this is now band which is fully filled with electrons\nand this is a band which is empty. So, what happens is that you can excite electrons from\nhere you can excite electrons from here to go there, another electron here to go there\nwhat happens then, how do we excite them we excite them by different ways we will come\nto that. But if we can excite electrons from here to there, what will happen is that this\nband is empty know. So, whenever the moment the electrons are\nhere they can flow; they can flow under the application of a electric field they can flow\nand if they flow they carry current what does it mean it means I can change the conductivity\nor the resistivity by what by deciding how many electrons I send there. If I send more\nelectrons the current will be more if I send less few electrons current will be less. If\nI send no electron there will be no current so, that is how you tune.\nIn metal this is not there that is why you cannot tune what happens in metal is that\nyour actually in metal we have not discussing on metal, but the highest fill states the\nhighest fill states you know this is the highest fill states for example, we call it some EF\nfor example. This is actually there is no band gap per say, but it is the electrons\nare the highest fill states they have lot of available states here this is you see empty.\nSo, they can immediately transport they can immediately carry current they do not have\nto excite anywhere. The highest occupied energy state per electron\nactually exists in such a way that you have energy states here itself you do not have\nto excite anywhere and in insulator this gap is so large. That from here you know that\nfrom here to excite there its almost impossible its very very large gap and that is why you\ncannot tune the conductivity that is where main reason of difference between insulator\nmetals and semiconductor. So, in semiconductor we are able to tune it in semiconductor you\nare able to tune the conductivity that is the beauty of semiconductor devices right. So, now I told you let us me use good color\nhere right. So, this is a fully filled band you understand now how bands are formed right\nI told you 2s level is here, 2p level is here as you bring the distance closer they split\nthey split right. These are filled and then this is a gap this is empty this is completely\nfilled this is band gap this is distance by the way. So, as I am bringing the atoms closer,\nI get this splitting up the band and that is why band gap is formed right.\nSo, this is how energy band gap is formed and this is how we come to this particular\nstate that this is filled this particular fully filled band is called valence band please\nremember, this is called valence band and this is fully filled with electrons. So, they\ncannot carry current why because electrons are completely filled know how will they move.\nFor current to flow electrons need empty states where they can move; electrons need empty\nstates where they can move to and only then current will flow if this is completely filled\nwith electrons then current cannot flow because electrons do not find any empty state to go.\nBut the moment, but the moment you excite one electron here right the moment you excite\none electron here this is empty so, that electron can now move and that is why current can flow.\nSo, electrons can only move here technically speaking and then this is called conduction\nband conduction band. So, conduction band is this empty band where electrons can be\nexcited, valence band is fully filled band where electrons cannot move and the energy\ndifference between them is the energy band gap. This unit of this energy we call electron\nvolt do you know what electron volt is 1 electron volt is how much that 1.6 into 10 to the power\nminus 19 joule remember. Electron volt electron volt is the energy\nnot voltage and I told you 1 electron volt is 1.6 into 10 to the power minus 19 joule\nand this electron volt is the unit of energy for semiconductor band gaps and energies ok.\nSo, the electron this is the band gap for example ok.\nNow, what is this gap in semiconductor this is the gap that is not too large I told you\nonly ok, only then you can excite the electrons from there to there know only then you can\nexcite electrons from here to there. So, that band gap cannot be too large, now what is\ntoo large what is too small? So, typically the most commonly used semiconductor is silicon\nok, the most commonly used semiconductor is silicon and silicon has an energy band gap\nEG is equal to 1.1 electron volt, that is the value. That means, silicon this is conduction\nband I call it C.B. and this is valence band I call it V.B. this is fully filled with electrons\nthis gap is 1.1 electron volt ok. You know one electron volt is this many joules\nright. So, this is the gap between conduction band and silicon and the valence band of silicon.\nSo, for you want to make silicon conducting you have to excite electrons from here to\nthere only then you can conduct electrons to right. So, this is the basic concept of\nenergy band and your band gap difference semiconductors have different band gaps. For example, in\ncase of Germanium its another semiconductor right Germanium is another semiconductor and\nin Germanium the band gap this gap is around 0.7 electron volt which is smaller than silicon\nyou know for Germanium this will be 0.7 which is smaller than silicon.\nSome materials can have much larger like 2 or 3 electron volt also even more than that\ninsulators have very very large band gap. For example, if I take an insulator say I\nwill take the insulator and for example, I will take aluminium oxide in that case the\nband gap might be very large it can be say 8 electron volt that is a very large large\ngap you cannot excite electrons from here to there. So, easily that is very difficult\nright. So, those are insulators and they do not conduct\nelectricity the beauty of semiconductor lies in the fact that you can actually change the\nnumber of electrons available here and that will help conduct electricity. So, that is\nwhy you can tune the conductivity or resistivity and you enable all these different wonderful\ndevices LEDs and so on and so forth ok. Then many many rich phenomena they are associated\nwith semiconductor devices we shall only go step by step there we shall only go step by\nstep there. So, you see when you have an empty band conduction\nband here and a fully filled valence band here and I told you 1.1 electron volt is the\nenergy band gap between this two in silicon in silicon this is semiconductor.\nNow, at there is always something called thermal energy you agree there is always something\ncalled thermal energy. At room temperature, any other temperature except 0 Kelvin you\nwill have thermal energy the atoms will vibrate there is always a thermal energy associated\nwith it. And if you have read your, you know high school physics you know that thermal\nenergy is given by kT you know what this k is this k is actually Boltzmann constant.\nI hope you have learned this kT is the sort of the thermal energy and T is temperature\nright. So, let us see a room temperature what is the thermal energy ok. So, for example,\nI take room temperature you know room temperature is around 300 Kelvin ok. So, what is kT, k\nvalue the Boltzmann constant is 1.38 into what 10 to the power minus 23 s i unit into\n300 Kelvin this is in joule this quantity is in joule I want it in electron volt. So,\nwhat should I do what should I do? I should divide by 1.6 into 10 to the power\nminus 19 because this is the 1 electron volt is so many joule right. So, I get in electron\nvolt. So, I will see that if I solve if I calculate this I will see that this is roughly\n0.0259 electron volt or I can say it is roughly 0.026 electron volt or you can say 26 milli\nelectron volt this is room temperature energy. So, at room temperature electrons will have\nthis energy which is 26 milli electron volt. Now 26 milli electron volt, which is 0.026\nelectron volt how much smaller is it compare to 1.1? It is very small and we know eventually\nwe learn that many of this processes like exciting carriers, that the combination, the\nlight emission, the carrier dynamics everything most of these things are actually exponentially\ndepended on the energy ok. So, if you have 1.1 electron volt as the band\ngap and only 0.026 as the thermal energy then it is very less probable their electrons would\nbe able to excite from this to that by thermal energy only right, but you are wrong actually\nit is possible and there are many things behind this why it is possible this thermal energy\nis very low. Despite that you can excite electrons from\nhere to there you can excite electrons from here to there low probability, but its ok,\nwe can still excite and that is why we have to understand the statistics of the distribution\nthat is very important. So, that is a lesson for another class we shall definitely come\nvery soon ok. Now, before we move ahead with those the statistics\nof how you can excite electrons even it is low thermal energy how you will get some electrons\nhere and how you will get current flowing and all these things we have to introduce\nsomething a little different. Everything that we are talking about here\nwas in respect to real distances or real space for those of you who are from electronics\nback ground who have done your mathematics probably its not necessary to know, but its\ngood thing to know. You know if you have a time domain if you\nhave time domain a signal you can do something called Fourier transform I do not know how\nmany of you know it, but you can do a Fourier transform we do not have to necessarily know\nit ok. Fourier transform of time gives you frequency and frequency omega has a unit of\n1 by time or 1 by second this is second. You need time to understand the time domain\nanalysis of signal, but if you do a Fourier transform mathematically you get frequency\ndomain signal it also helps to understand many other aspects similarly, a real space\nwe are talking about centimetre, nanometre, angstrom and so on right.\nThis is the real space like time it has a Fourier transform its called the reciprocal\nspace its called reciprocal space, its unit is 1 by centimetre or 1 by meter 1 by distance\nand that is useful in understanding many important things actually that is why we do that. Now\nsounds are little bit of abstract so, let us not go to deep immediately right now let\nus go step by step. Most of you know wavelength lambda not most\nof you all of you know all of you know lambda or wavelength corresponds to even electrons\nby the way because electrons are both particles and waves you know that right. So, wavelength\ncan be for electrons also it need not be only for like waves it can be like particle like\nwaves also. And there is something wavelength unit is by the way centimetre or meter that\nyou know the something called 2 pi by lambda have you come up this term 2 pi by lambda\nyou call it wave number probably I think right wave number.\nHere in this course we call this quantity as wave vector ok, 2 pi by lambda do you know\nwhat this quantity signifiers actually. In a way this quantity signifies the momentum\nof electron we will come to that you know momentum right of course, all of you know\nmomentum. You know this is wave vector and we call this represent this as k this k is\nnot the same as Boltzmann constant k by the way this is just a k.\nSo, we can put Boltzmann constant k is kB to represent that is Boltzmann constant and\nthis is just k we call it k and this is a unit this is just 2 pi by lambda is actually\nk we call it wave vector. In some sense it actually represents the momentum of electron\nwhat do I mean you know what is h planks constant of all of you know that right and you know\nwhat is h bar its the reduced plank constant it is given by h by what h by 2 pi ok.\nYou know this is reduced plank constant this is h by 2 pi. Now if I multiply h bar by k,\nk is this k what will I get what is k? k is 2 pi by lambda what will what will you get?\nYou will get h by lambda now if you recall de Broglie equation or Debra equation as you\ncan pronunciate differently h by lambda is what? P, what is p? P is momentum and this\nis from your high school physics by the way. So, h bar k is actually p which is actually\nthe momentum of the electron if I am talking about electron is the wave right you see that\nis why I told you k actually represents momentum because h bar is constant know your h bar\nis constant. So, constant times k is momentum. So, your k which is 2 pi by lambda actually\nrepresents the momentum of the electron in some way its a momentum of the electron you\nknow what is momentum right and you also know that the kinetic energy is given by momentum\nby p2 by 2 m right. So, it will become h square k square by 2\nm this is your kinetic energy of the electron and if you look at this equation very carefully\nright. If you look at this equation very carefully\nH square k square by 2 m this is the energy kinetic energy ok. So, if I plot sorry. So,\nif I plot E and if I plot k what is k actually? K is 2 pi by lambda I told you it is actually\nrepresentative of momentum, higher the k higher is the momentum ok.\nIf I plot E versus k, what is this E equal to h square k square by 2 m sorry its looking\nlike y equal to some alpha x square do you see its a parabola. So, the parabola will\nlook like this its a parabola right. So, the energy the energy is dependence the energy\ndependence on the momentum is actually a parabolic relation right energy dependence on momentum\nis a parabolic relation and what is this context? The context is actually of free electron.\nSo, if I talk about a free electron then this is the energy and momentum relation which\nis parabolic in nature it is parabolic in nature and this is for a free electron k by\nthe way has a unit of 1 by distance. So, it can be 1 by centimetre the k has a distance\nunit of 1 by centimetre so, this is good. Now, this is a free electron its called a\nfree electron and this is your you know the energy and momentum relation very good. But\na electron is not free inside a crystal right if I take a three dimensional crystal right\nreal crystal like silicon right, if I take a real crystal like this they all this atoms\nthey are now I mean they are periodically arranged not randomly arranged by the way.\nThey are all periodically arranged they are all periodically arranged, its a crystal if\nyou put an electron there, an electron will move you apply some voltage and there is a\nfield here. So, you apply an field electron will move know the electron will move when\nthe electron moves it sees its surrounding of a crystal which is periodic in nature,\nit sees a surrounding or an ambience which is periodic in nature in three dimension right\nits a periodic crystal. So, this equations and this diagram parabolic\ndiagram it only holds true for a free electron which is free to move in vacuum in a real\n3 D, no in a real periodic crystal an electron sees this periodicity that sort of effects\nits movement or its properties and so, it is very smooth parabola that we have here\nis actually not correct for an electron inside a real crystal.\nNow, you might ask where we trying to study this it is going to become to physics right\nwe are talking about energy bands and we are going to study the devices, but we are coming\nback from energy band and we are coming to disk kind of an E-k diagram its called an\nE-k diagram by the way. And we are talking about reciprocal space and momentum energy\nwhat is the relation of all this, the energy band that we are studying with the actual\npractical devices like LEDs or transistor that you are studying.\nThe relation is enormous kind of very very critical significance because this particular\nenergy bands this is also by the way actually an energy band by the way except that this\nis not with respect to x or distance, but this is with respect to momentum or k. All\nthese things will help us understand the basic physics of electron transport and electron\nproperties in a semiconductor and that is why that is the reason why we are trying to\nstudy this ok. Now, a free electron inside a crystal will\nnot see this more parabola in terms of in the sense that it will not have an energy\nk dependence as more as it is it is supposed to be for a free electron ok. So, what we\ndo now mathematically; mathematically we have to solve some question equations which we\nare not going to solve here mathematically you are going to solve some equations in the\npresence of periodic list lattice right here periodic lattice right.\nIn a in the presence of a periodic lattice an electron might move right, it will be scattered\nby this atoms because they are vibrating this atoms also setup potential, the electrons\nwill be scattered there will be impurity there will be so many things. So, real electron\nwhen it moves inside a crystal has a real world potential there you know and so, we\nhave to solve and equation in the presence of this periodic potential or a periodic you\nknow atoms to enable the actual representation of the E-k diagram and the equations ok.\nNow, the one simplifying assumption is that all this its not a assumption its actually\ntrue, but this atoms that are their periodically they set up a potential each atom will set\nup a potential like this right. There will be a core, there will be atoms these electrons\nare their of course, but this is a potential its like an infinitely deep potential and\nto make things simpler to make things simpler we will only talk about one dimensional period,\nno two dimensional its a same thing you can extrapolate two and three later on, but these\nare atoms that are periodically arranged. All of them have a spacing sorry all of them\nhave a spacing a, a is lattice constant it can be say 5 angstrom may be or 4 angstrom\nor whatever right that\u2019s depends on the crystal. So, this is spacing is \u2018a\u2019 everywhere\nmy drawing may not be accurate, but this is all \u2018a\u2019 ok. So, essentially I am talking\nabout a potential all of them are potential they are generating some potential like this\nits called periodic potential. I can draw this and I will assume these periodic\npotentials are nearly infinite which means I can draw this as like this, what am I drawing\nactually? I am drawing the periodic potentials as wells you know you know this energy well\nthis is a infinitely high potential and this is an energy well its called like a quantum\nwell ok. So, my drawing is not accurate of course,\nbut these are energy wells. So, we can have a periodic potential which is infinite in\nnumber and electron will move in this presence of this periodic potential well. So, we have\nto solve and understand the electron movement in the presence of periodic potential well\nok. Now, you might say that what is the point\nof all this, the point of all this is that we will able to understand some very very\nimportant concept what on the most important concept is the mass of electron inside the\nperiodic potential you know. If I take a three dimensional crystal lattice, I told you right\nif I take a three dimensional silicon, an electron is moving inside the crystal then\nthe mass of electron inside the crystal is not the free electron mass.\nYou know electron mass is free electron mass is 9.1 into 10 to the power 31 kg that is\nthe free electron mass of the electron as it moves through vacuum or free space, but\nthe moment the electron moves through a crystal this mass will change why because there are\nso many imperfections in the crystal there is the periodic potential. The periodic potential\nof this atomic arrangement will disturb the electron movement it will interact with the\nlattice. So, this effect this mass the electron mass\nthat moves inside a crystal that mass that it feels is actually different from this mass\nits called effective electron mass effective electron mass. And we represent which are\nm star and that is different from the free electron mass and that effective electron\nmass how much it is their inside a crystal, but its a value is the most important thing\nwe need to know the current flows and many other things and this effective mass can be\nunderstood from this periodic potential then I am discussing about ok.\nSo, we shall end the class here today there is a lot of introduction that we have brought\nabout. So, what we shall do in the next class is we will take from this point we will go\ninto where we will go into the concept of effective mass and we will also introduce\nthe concept of hole what is hole there is something called hole ok. We will introduce\nthe concept of effective mass, we will introduce the concept of holes and then we will also\nintroduce the concepts of distribution of electrons distribution of electrons how electrons\nare distributed in valence and conduction band.\nYou remember this diagram that I keep drawing here, this diagram right this is conduction\nband, this is valence band how electrons are distributed here, how many electrons are there,\nhow many electrons are here all these things depend on statistics ,its called Fermi Dirac\nstatistics. So, we shall introduce the concept of Fermi\nDirac statistics in next class, introduce the concept of Fermi Dirac statistics we will\nalso introduce the concept of effective mass and holes what are holes and those will helps\nus basically go ahead with the 3rd lecture where we introduce doping and other things\nok. So, today\u2019s class what did we recap we should\nhave a quick recap for 1 minute today\u2019s class I told you that semiconductor devices\nare very important that most important probably you know in the electronic industry everything\ndepends on semiconductor devices. So, many types of semiconductor devices there\nthat we may not be even aware off right and it as had a long history from 1948 right. When first transistor was invented in BJT\nI mean and to 2018 when we have transistors of the scale of 14 nanometre, 10 nanometre\nyou know its very sophisticated platform now. Moore\u2019s law is there and this scaling of\ntransistor is continued over so much so many years, but this is not transistor only for\nyour processor chips that going to laptops and cell phones.\nThere are many other transistors very which are not scaled up because they are required\nfor RF power or radio power you know radio frequency power application those do not scale\nlike this there are many kinds of transistors or LEDs or solar cells do not scale like this\nthere are many other devices their right we talked about bands. What are energy bands and how do they come\nabout there are different kinds of semiconductor I told you and to introduce the concept of\nband I told you that you have to go to a single atom, We have to talk about the discrete energy\nlevels. The moment you start bringing the atoms close\ntogether this discrete energy levels will split up they will split up to form some bands. And this bands will give you band gap and\nthat\u2019s why you have a highest fill band sorry highest fill band and empty band here\nthe separated band energy band gap for insulator this is very large, for metals there are no\nband gaps, for semiconductor this band gap is appreciable. So, that you can actually\nexcite electrons from the fully filled valence band to the empty conduction band and but\ndoing that you can increase the conductivity or resistivity of the material that\u2019s the\nbeauty of semiconductor you can tune the conductivity and then we talked about the electron volt\nthe concept of electron volt how much is the energy silicon.\nGermanium and different materials have different band gaps this is dictated by many properties\nof the material and finally, we came to the in the reciprocal space I introduce the concept\nof 2 pi by lambda as k, which is sort of an momentum actually 2 pi by lambda is the k\nis a sort of a representation of momentum. I told you we are that E-k diagram or the\nenergy and momentum relation is a parabolic relation for free electron in vacuum or in\nspace and I told you that the moment electron is put inside a real crystal like silicon\nor germanium or so on and so forth. The periodic potential will basically effect\nthe moment of electron and. So, the mass of electron as experienced inside the crystal\nalso changes we call it effective mass ok. You please recall that all these atoms that\nare there arranged periodically in a crystalline solid, set up this periodic potential and\nthat\u2019s why the periodic potential distorts the movement of the electron and that is why\nwe get this you know different effective masses inside a crystal.\nAnd that\u2019s why the energy the concept of energy band gap actually arises only when\nthere is a crystalline solid because, if this crystalline or the periodicity of this distance\nis not maintained then you cannot solve the equations you cannot actually gap practically\nspeaking you will not have a periodic potential and so you cannot have a uniformed band gap\nalso ok So, we will end the class here today and in\nthe next class we will continue with the concept of effective mass we will introduce holes\nyou know electrons are as much important as holes. Holes are also some kind of quazi particles\nthat carry current. And we will introduce the concepts of if possible doping and before\nthat distribution Fermi Dirac distribution that will tell you how electrons are filling\nup the bands you know how many electrons are there in a semiconductor, what is a probability\nthat electrons are there and how many electrons are there all these things are captured by\nFermi Dirac statistics and then we introduce the concept of doping and by doping you can\nactually change the conductivity ok. The other approaches are for example, by shining\nlight that is a different thing that is used for photo detector and solar cells you know,\nbut without light you can also change by adding some impurities called doping.\nSo, those things will try to introduced in the next class we will also try to correlate\npractical applications. As, I keep telling you in the beginning how these devices correlate\nwith practical life examples right we shall have that in mind. So, we do not lose track\nof that ok. So, with this will end the class today and I will hope to see you in the next\nclass where we shall discuss about effective mass, holes and Fermi Dirac distribution ok.\nThank you."}}
